He was incredibly handsome, with tanned skin, light brown hair, and green eyes. A sweet, passionate young boy, his loyalty knew no bounds, especially when it came to his aunt-turned-mother-figure, Morgana. He was all but raised by his aunt after his parents both left the world and didn't know either of them particularly well. He later went on to die in her arms after being stabbed by Uther Pendragon on February 8th, 2015.</p><p><em>Gideon Isaiah Joel Martain</em></p><p>The son of Amber Charlene Martain and the archangel Gabriel, Gideon was born on November 15th, 2014. Taking his dark hair from his mother, he also had honey coloured eyes, and his father's facial structure. He was raised mainly by his mother and grew to be a boy incredibly devoted to his family, which was made up of the people from his parents' world. After getting ill shortly after his mother left the world, Gideon's fever refused to break and killed him on June 12th, 2015.</p><hr><p>The two boys also have faceclaims (mainly for creating forum related things, like photosets), not identified anywhere in the world:</p><p>Allard Pendragon: <em>Thomas McDonell</em></p><p>Gideon Martain: <em>Torrance Coombs</em></p><hr><p><em>(Pregnancies and stork deliveries can only be accepted by <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2554469/TheName-sBob\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Rhya</span></a> and <a href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/2742265/xX-The-Mad-Man-With-A-Box-Xx\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Lena</span></a>.

Each fandom has a different date, which can be found in both the Character List and Welcome Topic. Characters will not gain new memories from their universe after the point they have been taken from.</li> <li>When characters are newly arrived, they have no memory of being in the world before - what happened to them the last time they were in the world is completely irrelevant to a new roleplayer. Other characters may tell them what happened the last time they were in the world.</li> <li>Characters don't die, they respawn - unless an episode specifies otherwise, or they're a World-Born Child. Their body will be in the same condition as it was when they arrived, but with their memories intact, so if they spend ages getting fit, all their hard work will be undone upon dying.</li> <li>If a character is ill at the point you took them from, they will remain ill - arriving in the world won't heal them. If you'd rather they weren't sick, take them from a point where they are healthy, or have them healed somehow. Again, if they die, they will respawn ill again.</li> <li>Characters don't age - even people born within the world have their age frozen eventually. For the duration of their stay in this world, the characters will remain the same age.</li> <li>Characters can't change life state - as in, they can't become something like a vampire or werewolf. Their entire time in The Convergence, they will be whatever species they were when they arrived.</li> <li>Characters are the only people in the world - there are no NPCs. Other than themselves, and animals/monsters, the world is like a ghost town. They have to do everything for themselves. Money is irrelevant. Internet, mobiles, and immune systems all function as normal.</li> <li>The world functions on real-time - meaning the date will always be exactly the same in The Convergence as it is in our world.</li> <li>Objects like the TARDIS are not in the world - even though the world runs on real-time, the future does not necessarily exist, and therefore things such as the TARDIS and time-turners are not present in it.</li> <li>Things such as droids or AIs cannot be created within the world - this is because they have the potential to be programmed in such a way that would make them more like actual characters. If somebody attempts to build such a thing, the world will simply fry the systems.</li> </ul>  <span style='float:right'><script>render_actions(2554469,146535,108548484,158816425,1,0,1, 2554469);</script></span><small class=xgray><span class=xdate  data-xutime='1483319129'>1/1/2017</span> .

By this, it's meant that Avada Kedavra could kill an angel or a demon, or an angel could smite an Original vampire. How powerful the other being is doesn't matter; they will be treated like a human under the effects of another being's magic.</li> <li><strong>Instant Healing</strong> - it is not possible for somebody to be healed instantly and completely, be it by magic or at the touch of an angel. For it to take a few hours is okay, but healing that takes seconds, or no time at all, is not. They could be partly healed, but not completely - this would take longer.</li> <li><strong>Instant Killing</strong> - killing people with a wordless click of the fingers is not possible. Killing somebody must be somehow avoidable - even Avada Kedavra is acceptable, as the spell could be dodged. This is to stop characters being too overpowered.</li> <li><strong>Bodies</strong> - Time Lord regenerations are void in this world, the character would simply die and respawn instead. Angels cannot leave or change vessels. Demons that are actually characters - such as Crowley - can't change who they're possessing.</li> <li><strong>On Demons</strong> - if somebody is being possessed by a demon, as soon as the host dies, the demon won't be in possession of them any more. This is because as soon as a person dies, they respawn.</li> </ul>  <span style='float:right'><script>render_actions(2554469,146535,108548484,158816614,1,0,1, 2554469);</script></span><small class=xgray><span class=xdate  data-xutime='1483319411'>1/1/2017</span> .

Edited 12/30/2017 #1 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Overview * A picture to show a rough geography of the world (made by Eli): theconvergenceroleplay.tumblr.com/post/163605674494 Like every world before it, this one is unique in its own way. Reminiscent of the fourth world, there are islands, although this time there are only two of them. They sit next to one another, and are connected only by a small stone bridge. Surrounding both of these islands is an endless sea, which also flows beneath the bridge. Similar to the sixth world's 'Empyrean' and 'Infernos', one of these islands could be considered 'good' and one could be described as 'evil'. The names of these islands are 'D\u00f9rachd' and 'Olc'. 6/28/2014 . Edited by Gracie Holmes, 9/15/2017 #2 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) The Islands - 'D\u00f9rachd' and 'Olc' Both islands are practically identical to one another in terms of shape and size. However, the appearances of the buildings and places that are sat upon them are extremely different. When facing north, Olc would sit on the left side of a map, while D\u00f9rachd would be on the right hand side. A large castle sits in the centre of each island. On D\u00f9rachd, this castle is made out of white marble, whereas on Olc, it is made out of black marble. Above the castle on Olc, there is always a storm cloud, and it is always raining and lightning. A constant mist is also around the castle. As a result of this, the entire island of Olc is subject to miserable weather and grey skies, which gets worse the closer to the castle a person is. This weather is a sharp contrast to the picturesque sky of D\u00f9rachd, where the weather is always sunny, though not too hot, and no more than a handful of clouds will be found in the sky at a time, if at all. Identical villages surround the castles. Although each village contains the exact same shops, the exterior of these buildings on Olc are dark, crooked and intimidating . D\u00f9rachd's shops are much softer looking and attractive in appearance, with adorable thatched roofs to top them off. All of the buildings are extremely rural and traditional-looking. Each island also has cobbled roads and dirt paths webbing across it, which are more overgrown on Olc. The grass that otherwise covers the ground is lush green on D\u00f9rachd and a foreboding, darker shade of green on Olc. The edge of Olc is made up of very sudden, jagged cliffs and sharp rocks surround the island. D\u00f9rachd, on the other hand, has sloping, green banks leading to the water. 6/28/2014 . Edited 6/9/2017 #3 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) The Villages Unlike other worlds, this one has very specific shops. Aside from ruined ones that need to be rebuilt to be of any use, there are no bars or cafes. Each island has the exact same shops: * Arts & Crafts Shop - Crown Crafts - Need paint? It's here. Paintbrushes? Got it. Pompoms? Yep. This shop can fulfill any artsy needs * Baby Shop - Rumplestiltskin's Baby Supplies - Babies need many things, including clothing, mini furniture and special food. Fortunately, all of it can be found here. * Bed Shop - Pealess Mattress Store - Sleep is vital. This shop provides bed bases, pillows, bedsheets, mattresses...anything a person may require to sleep peacefully. * Bookshop - Happily Ever After - Weirdly enough, this shop provides a variety of books. * Barbers/Hairdressers - Top of the Tower Trimmers - Having good hair is important, so within this shop, there is magical equipment that can be told what style of hair to cut. They'll do it all for free. * Chemist - Alchemy and Arsenic - This shop provides minor medical supplies. * Clothing - The Emperor's Clothing Emporium - As interesting as nudism is, it's not what anyone really wants to see in The Convergence. * DIY - Ye Olde DIY Shop - There's nothing like having a go at building or fixing something up. This shop provides all the supplies that might be needed to do so. * Electrical Store - Grimm's Electrics - Anything electrical can be found here, from phones to TVs. There's even a section for DVDs and video games. * Florist - Tulips & Toadstools - Here, there are flowers. * Garden Shop - The Secret Garden - Shovels and seeds to allow the best gardens to be created. * General Store - Fabled Stuff - Sometimes, the other shops just aren't enough. This shop provides what the other shops can't. * Grocery Store - The Old Chestnut - Everybody needs to eat. * Jewellery Store - The Bronze Tiara - There are rings and necklaces and bracelets galore. * Music Shop - Mermaids & Melodies - Everything needed to make a tune can be found here. * Pet Shop - Dragons and Other Household Pets - Aside from fish, this shop only provides pet supplies rather than the actual pets themselves. * Shoe Shop - Old Woman's Shoe House - It'd be uncomfortable walking across the world without any shoes on. * Stationery Store - Quality Quills - Pens and papers and other such things. * Toy Shop - Geppetto's - The widest range of toys that could be imagined, for all the children of the world. * Weaponry Shop - Old Enemies Die Hard - Nobody under the age of 18 is able to access this shop, which is intended to allow the population of the world to protect themselves. Each island also has a museum within its village, where occupants of the world can find a stand with their name upon it. On this stand there will be five objects relating to their life, which they are free to remove from the museum, if they so please. 6/28/2014 . Edited 6/9/2017 #4 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Notable Places on D\u00f9rachd Other than its village and castle, D\u00f9rachd has several other locations that can be used and explored. These include: * A Pot of Gold - Located in the bottom right of the island, there is a pot of gold. From this extends a rainbow, which arches over the island. The rainbow can be followed back to the pot of gold. Unfortunately, the gold is fake, and if stolen, will disappear within twelve hours. * D\u00f9rachd Forest - This is located in the top left of the island. The trees here are always in blossom. When a person is here, they will feel light and happy and be overcome with the urge to sing. * The Memory Room (made by Eva and Wolfie) - At the far right of the island, there is a large, square, empty building that at first looks plain and boring and white, but once someone steps into it, they will see some of the best moments of their life play out around them like a 3D movie. However, if the door shuts behind them, it'll lock for the next hour and some of the worst moments of their life, in the past or future, will play out. * The Snowy Caverns - In the top right of the island, there are a series of snowy caverns. Inside of these it is extremely cold. It is here that the white wolf, protector of the island, lives. Snow falls endlessly here. Somehow, every snowflake is perfect in appearance and won't melt, even if balanced on a fingertip. * The Waterfall Cave - At the bottom of the island, there is a beach with white-golden sand, and just above this there is a miraculous waterfall which does not have a source - it simply flows onto the sand. If a person steps through this water, they will find themselves in a cave, where there are thousands of golden artifacts. The gold, if stolen, will disappear within twelve hours. As well as this, the water washes away magical powers/abilities temporarily, so anybody who steps into the cave will become human while they are there. It is also on this island that the graveyard containing the graves of deceased Worldborns can be found. 6/28/2014 . Edited 6/9/2017 #5 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Notable Places on Olc There are also several unique locations on Olc: * Olc Forest - Located in the top right of Olc, this forest is incredibly different to the one found directly opposite it. The trees here are tall and twisted, and the leaves are so dense, almost no light reaches the forest floor. People will suffer from auditory and visual hallucinations, if they happen to wander in. * The Caves - These dark, moist caves are in the top left of Olc, and are home to the dreaded dragon. Within the caves is an intricate, maze-like system, which may be incredibly difficult to escape from... * The Orchard - Sat on the far left of the island, there is an orchard. Some of the apple trees here are perfectly safe. However, many of them hold poisoned apples. If eaten, the consumer will be rendered unconscious. If within 48 hours, they have not been given a kiss by someone who loves them, the person will die, and will not respawn for a week. The apples can be removed from the orchard and turned into other products, such as pies and juice. * The Shipwreck - At the bottom of the island, if a person were to look over the edge of the huge cliff, they would see a shipwreck, mostly submerged. Pieces of the large wooden ship remain lodged on the rocks, no matter how many times waves crash over them. Although treacherous to try and get to, fascinating objects from other worlds can be found here. * The Wishing Well - At the bottom left of Olc, there is a large lake, with an enormous crocodile lurking in the depths of it. Sitting in the centre of this lake there is a smaller island. On top of this, there is a wishing well. Anyone can make a wish at this well, though it is not guaranteed to come true, or may not come true in the way they were expecting. (Please PM Rhya if you would like to have a character's wish fulfilled somehow). 6/28/2014 . Edited 6/9/2017 #6 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Fandom Ruins For the first time in a long time, the world contains fandom buildings. However, these buildings are not in the state they ought to be. Instead, they are in total disrepair, falling apart and collapsing, as if they have been destroyed. It is up to the occupants of the worlds to fix these buildings. Some should be repaired more urgently, such as the hospital, as there is nowhere else to fix people up within the world. (To repair a building, a character must repair it during a roleplay - it cannot happen 'off-screen'. Please PM Rhya if your character fixes a building. A building cannot be fixed completely all at once - magic/powers can't be used and will only cause the building to deteriorate further. Each character can repair each building by 5% daily. AIs and flight/time travel equipment cannot be repaired. Cars and other engine powered vehicles will not work. Buildings can also not be moved into - characters can only live in the cottages.) These buildings are spread across both islands, and only include the following: Supernatural: * The Bunker (Olc) * Singer Salvage Yard (D\u00f9rachd) * The Roadhouse (Olc) - 30% repaired Harry Potter: * The Leaky Cauldron (D\u00f9rachd) * The Burrow (Olc) * Hagrid's Hut (D\u00f9rachd) Marvel: * Nelson and Murdock Law Office (Olc) * The Bus, crashed (D\u00f9rachd) * Milano, crashed (Olc) Sherlock: * 221 Baker Street (includes 221B, 221C, and Mrs Hudson's flat) (D\u00f9rachd) * Metropolitan Police Building (Olc) Doctor Who: * The TARDIS, crashed (2005 version - includes main deck, wardrobe, swimming pool and library, but nowhere else) (D\u00f9rachd) - 10% repaired Percy Jackson: * Camp Half-Blood (Olc) The Vampire Diaries: * Mystic Grill (D\u00f9rachd) * Lafayette Cemetery (Olc) The Hunger Games: * Katniss' House in the Seam (D\u00f9rachd) * District 12 Mine (Olc) Merlin: * The Rising Sun Tavern (D\u00f9rachd) Once Upon a Time: * Jolly Rodger, beached (D\u00f9rachd) * Granny's Diner (Olc) - 10% repaired Divergent: * The Prior House (Olc) Fox MCU: * Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (D\u00f9rachd) Star Trek: * Enterprise-A, crashed (Olc) The Maze Runner: * The Homestead (D\u00f9rachd) DC: * Fortress of Solitude (D\u00f9rachd) * The Waverider, crashed (Olc) - 30% repaired * The Bunker (Arrowcave) (D\u00f9rachd) - 100% repaired Star Wars: * Lars homestead (Olc) * Millennium Falcon, crashed (D\u00f9rachd) - 50% repaired Lord of the Rings: * Bag End (Olc) The Mortal Instruments: * New York Institute (TV series) (D\u00f9rachd) - 5% repaired * New York Institute (book version) (Olc) - 10% repaired House: * 221B Baker Street (D\u00f9rachd) * Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (Olc) Live-Action Disney: * Belle's House (D\u00f9rachd) * Rapunzel's Tower (from Into the Woods) (Olc) Twilight: * Jacob Black's House (D\u00f9rachd) * Cullen House (Olc) 7/13/2015 . Edited by x Bout as Stable as the Wind x, 10/3/2017 #7 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Creatures of D\u00f9rachd and Olc D\u00f9rachd and Olc both share the same animals and monsters, gathered from the different worlds within The Convergence. They are all free to roam wherever they may please in the world. On both islands, all horses have unicorn horns. In addition to this, each island has its own individual creatures. They cannot move between the two islands. On D\u00f9rachd, these are: * A wolf - This magnificent, white wolf protects the people of the island and will show up randomly to destroy threats. She lives in the Snowy Caverns. Anybody who lives on her island will be protected and never harmed by her. * A kraken - Somehow, this 30m long beast swims in the sea around D\u00f9rachd. Its tentacles will grab and crush anyone who swims close to it. On Olc, these are: * A dragon - At any time, this dragon may swoop down and grab innocent wanderers and take them back to the caves where it lives. Its roar can be heard all the way across the bridge. Fire-breathing and giant, with claws like swords to boot, this creature is not one to be taken lightly. * A crocodile - The protector of the well, this 25 foot crocodile will do its best to stop anyone getting to the centre of the lake. It will not go outside of the perimeter of the lake, but may climb up onto the island in the middle in order to protect its property. (As always, nobody is obligated to include monsters or animals in their roleplays. They are to be used like objects, not people (unless some form of possession is involved). Animals should not be harmed during roleplays, and you may be issued a warning if you do.) 12/16/2015 . Edited 6/9/2017 #8 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Transportation Unfortunately, there are no longer cars to get around the world. The best way to travel is in the carriages that can be found on the cobbled roads. They have nothing pulling them, but move anyway, going wherever they are told to go. It is still possible for people to teleport and ride bicycles around, but teleportation from one island to another is not an option, making the carriages - which can be hailed at any time - the fastest way to travel. 12/16/2015 . Edited 6/9/2017 #9 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Housing Housing is scattered across both islands, in the form of small cottages. The exterior of these cottages are adorned with candy-like decor. Occupants of the world have a lot of flexibility when choosing where they would prefer to live. One possibility is that they choose a cottage with between one and four bedrooms and decorate it fully, in any way they would like. They can also choose whether or not they would like a back and/or a front garden, which again would be theirs to design. Alternatively, they can opt for a house which will adapt to suit them after they choose it. This means that the number of bedrooms and whether it has a garden will be decided after they move in, as will what those bedrooms and garden contain. The cottage will not be ridiculously oversized, but will reflect its owners as best as it possibly can. The house will specify whether it is 'decoratable' or 'adaptable' on its front door. This sign will vanish after somebody has moved in. After someone decides on the house they want to live in, a key will land in their pocket and their name will appear a plaque by the door. All occupants must agree for somebody else to move in. 12/16/2015 . Edited 6/9/2017 #10 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Arriving/Respawning When someone first appears in the world, they will awaken to find themselves submerged underneath the water, beneath the bridge. Hopefully they don't panic too much, or don't have difficulty swimming, because that would likely lead to drowning. Unless they were born in the world, however, that's okay - if they perish, they will simply respawn under the surface of the water once again. 12/16/2015 . Edited 6/9/2017 #11 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Magic Mirror In their pocket - or their hand, if no pockets are present - every person will find a handheld mirror. This mirror is linked to their soul. If it is damaged, they will feel it, and if the damage is severe enough, they will die. The mirrors are capable of showing people many things, should they ask to see something, including other people, locations, and themselves. 12/16/2015 . Edited 6/9/2017 #12 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) The Clock High in the sky, far above everything, there is a clock. This clock acts like a moon . It does not tell the time like a regular clock, and takes twelve days to reach twelve o'clock. Whenever the clock hits twelve, it is classified as a full moon. Werewolves will therefore transform on that day, and general behaviour may be out of sorts. 5/13/2016 . Edited 6/9/2017 #13 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Letters Every week, the people of the world will receive a letter addressed to them. It will be blown onto their doorstep. The letter has a wax seal, which is shaped like rays of light (similar to the forum's icon) . The contents of this letter is what is shown at the start of each topic. 5/13/2016 . Edited 6/9/2017 #14 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Utilities Providing all that the people of the Convergence may need are a handful of utilities. These are: * Convergence Connected (aka ConConn) - the world's TV, broadband and mobile provider. Phone and TV screens may load up with a 'ConConn' logo screen. Usually of a very good quality, this service has only ever been briefly slowed down by weather. * ConFlow - the world's water utility service. Provides the much needed water necessary for toilets, showers, baths, and of course, drinking. * ConZap! - the world's general electricity provider, helping to light up the world and ensure technology works continuously. 1/1/2017 . Edited 6/9/2017 #15 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Worldborn Children A Worldborn Child is a child that has been born into the world to two people who have been drawn into the world. Alternatively, a Worldborn Child may be a child delivered to parent(s) who would otherwise be incapable of reproduction via a stork. After an abnormally fast pregnancy (unless delivered by stork), which takes only 3 weeks, the children then take only 9 short weeks to reach their full maturity, looking anywhere between 17 and 20. At this point, their ageing will freeze and they won't grow anymore. There have been a total of 18 Worldborn Children born so far: * Allard Pendragon \u2020 * Gideon Isaiah Joel Martain \u2020 * Jaxon Barrett Winters (died September 2015, resurrected May 2017 as a reward for the Bingo.) * Ava Morgause Gorlois * Matthew Arthur Weasley * Riley Grace Weasley * Isabelle Nicole Fitz-Simmons * Zariah Hope Celestia Holmes * Mason Jay Winters * Braedon Dwaine Gorlois * Zachary Michael Fitz-Simmons * William Sterling Romanov-Holmes * Oscar George Bell-Weasley * Kendra Claire Watson * Alara May Derek * Evie Laurel Queen * Kalina Rose Mikaelson * Genevieve Addison Dare Unlike other characters within the world, world-born children die. Once they die, they don't respawn, they are simply dead forevermore, with no chance of ever returning. Should a child die, their headstone in the graveyard specifically for Worldborn Children is already prepared. In a small building at the graveyard, there are two small pieces of writing to memorialise the two Worldborn Children that have passed away, presented as follows alongside a headshot: Allard Pendragon The son of Guinevere and Arthur Pendragon, Allard was born on August 30th, 2014. He was incredibly handsome, with tanned skin, light brown hair, and green eyes. A sweet, passionate young boy, his loyalty knew no bounds, especially when it came to his aunt-turned-mother-figure, Morgana. He was all but raised by his aunt after his parents both left the world and didn't know either of them particularly well. He later went on to die in her arms after being stabbed by Uther Pendragon on February 8th, 2015. Gideon Isaiah Joel Martain The son of Amber Charlene Martain and the archangel Gabriel, Gideon was born on November 15th, 2014. Taking his dark hair from his mother, he also had honey coloured eyes, and his father's facial structure. He was raised mainly by his mother and grew to be a boy incredibly devoted to his family, which was made up of the people from his parents' world. After getting ill shortly after his mother left the world, Gideon's fever refused to break and killed him on June 12th, 2015. The two boys also have faceclaims (mainly for creating forum related things, like photosets), not identified anywhere in the world: Allard Pendragon: Thomas McDonell Gideon Martain: Torrance Coombs (Pregnancies and stork deliveries can only be accepted by  Rhya  and  Lena . Do not initiate this without asking for permission, because this is a major life event and you will be issued a warning.) 1/1/2017 . Edited by Gracie Holmes, 8/31/2017 #16 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Storks If somebody makes a wish at the well to have a child, there is a chance that it will be fulfilled by a stork. Alternatively, people incapable of reproduction may suddenly be gifted a child by the world, which would be delivered by a stork. These children are exactly the same as Worldborn children, aside from the fact they will not be genetically related to their parent(s). Therefore, the child could look completely different to them, and may also have entirely different powers, from one of the other worlds. A baby delivered by a stork will be well-swaddled when it is placed on the doorstep of its new family. It will look like a newborn and grow normally, like any other Worldborn. The baby's Magic Mirror will be tucked somewhere within the blanket, which has 'With love' stitched onto it. (The usual rules apply. Requests must be PM'd to Lena or Rhya.) 1/1/2017 . Edited 6/9/2017 #17 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) The World's Basic Rules * Characters can be taken from any point after the fixed start date of their fandom - the fixed date could alter depending on the release of further pieces of media. Each fandom has a different date, which can be found in both the Character List and Welcome Topic. Characters will not gain new memories from their universe after the point they have been taken from. * When characters are newly arrived, they have no memory of being in the world before - what happened to them the last time they were in the world is completely irrelevant to a new roleplayer. Other characters may tell them what happened the last time they were in the world. * Characters don't die, they respawn - unless an episode specifies otherwise, or they're a World-Born Child. Their body will be in the same condition as it was when they arrived, but with their memories intact, so if they spend ages getting fit, all their hard work will be undone upon dying. * If a character is ill at the point you took them from, they will remain ill - arriving in the world won't heal them. If you'd rather they weren't sick, take them from a point where they are healthy, or have them healed somehow. Again, if they die, they will respawn ill again. * Characters don't age - even people born within the world have their age frozen eventually. For the duration of their stay in this world, the characters will remain the same age. * Characters can't change life state - as in, they can't become something like a vampire or werewolf. Their entire time in The Convergence, they will be whatever species they were when they arrived. * Characters are the only people in the world - there are no NPCs. Other than themselves, and animals/monsters, the world is like a ghost town. They have to do everything for themselves. Money is irrelevant. Internet, mobiles, and immune systems all function as normal. * The world functions on real-time - meaning the date will always be exactly the same in The Convergence as it is in our world. * Objects like the TARDIS are not in the world - even though the world runs on real-time, the future does not necessarily exist, and therefore things such as the TARDIS and time-turners are not present in it. * Things such as droids or AIs cannot be created within the world - this is because they have the potential to be programmed in such a way that would make them more like actual characters. If somebody attempts to build such a thing, the world will simply fry the systems. 1/1/2017 . Edited 6/9/2017 #18 [ALazyGeek](/u/2554469/ALazyGeek) Powers * Powers and Magic - these effect beings from different fandoms as though they were human beings. By this, it's meant that Avada Kedavra could kill an angel or a demon, or an angel could smite an Original vampire. How powerful the other being is doesn't matter; they will be treated like a human under the effects of another being's magic. * Instant Healing - it is not possible for somebody to be healed instantly and completely, be it by magic or at the touch of an angel. For it to take a few hours is okay, but healing that takes seconds, or no time at all, is not. They could be partly healed, but not completely - this would take longer. * Instant Killing - killing people with a wordless click of the fingers is not possible. Killing somebody must be somehow avoidable - even Avada Kedavra is acceptable, as the spell could be dodged. This is to stop characters being too overpowered. * Bodies - Time Lord regenerations are void in this world, the character would simply die and respawn instead. Angels cannot leave or change vessels. Demons that are actually characters - such as Crowley - can't change who they're possessing. * On Demons - if somebody is being possessed by a demon, as soon as the host dies, the demon won't be in possession of them any more. This is because as soon as a person dies, they respawn. 1/1/2017 .

Reminiscent of the fourth world, there are islands, although this time there are only two of them. They sit next to one another, and are connected only by a small stone bridge. Surrounding both of these islands is an endless sea, which also flows beneath the bridge. Similar to the sixth world's 'Empyrean' and 'Infernos', one of these islands could be considered 'good' and one could be described as 'evil'. The names of these islands are 'D\u00f9rachd' and 'Olc'."

    "surface_form": "Both islands are practically identical to one another in terms of shape and size. However, the appearances of the buildings and places that are sat upon them are extremely different. When facing north, Olc would sit on the left side of a map, while D\u00f9rachd would be on the right hand side. A large castle sits in the centre of each island. On D\u00f9rachd, this castle is made out of white marble, whereas on Olc, it is made out of black marble. Above the castle on Olc, there is always a storm cloud, and it is always raining and lightning. A constant mist is also around the castle. As a result of this, the entire island of Olc is subject to miserable weather and grey skies, which gets worse the closer to the castle a person is. This weather is a sharp contrast to the picturesque sky of D\u00f9rachd, where the weather is always sunny, though not too hot, and no more than a handful of clouds will be found in the sky at a time, if at all. Identical villages surround the castles. Although each village contains the exact same shops, the exterior of these buildings on Olc are dark, crooked and intimidating . D\u00f9rachd's shops are much softer looking and attractive in appearance, with adorable thatched roofs to top them off. All of the buildings are extremely rural and traditional-looking. Each island also has cobbled roads and dirt paths webbing across it, which are more overgrown on Olc. The grass that otherwise covers the ground is lush green on D\u00f9rachd and a foreboding, darker shade of green on Olc. The edge of Olc is made up of very sudden, jagged cliffs and sharp rocks surround the island. D\u00f9rachd, on the other hand, has sloping, green banks leading to the water."

    "surface_form": "The Villages Unlike other worlds, this one has very specific shops. Aside from ruined ones that need to be rebuilt to be of any use, there are no bars or cafes. Each island has the exact same shops: * Arts & Crafts Shop - Crown Crafts - Need paint? It's here. Paintbrushes? Got it. Pompoms? Yep. This shop can fulfill any artsy needs * Baby Shop - Rumplestiltskin's Baby Supplies - Babies need many things, including clothing, mini furniture and special food. Fortunately, all of it can be found here. * Bed Shop - Pealess Mattress Store - Sleep is vital. This shop provides bed bases, pillows, bedsheets, mattresses...anything a person may require to sleep peacefully. * Bookshop - Happily Ever After - Weirdly enough, this shop provides a variety of books. * Barbers/Hairdressers - Top of the Tower Trimmers - Having good hair is important, so within this shop, there is magical equipment that can be told what style of hair to cut. They'll do it all for free. * Chemist - Alchemy and Arsenic - This shop provides minor medical supplies. * Clothing - The Emperor's Clothing Emporium - As interesting as nudism is, it's not what anyone really wants to see in The Convergence. * DIY - Ye Olde DIY Shop - There's nothing like having a go at building or fixing something up. This shop provides all the supplies that might be needed to do so. * Electrical Store - Grimm's Electrics - Anything electrical can be found here, from phones to TVs. There's even a section for DVDs and video games. * Florist - Tulips & Toadstools - Here, there are flowers. * Garden Shop - The Secret Garden - Shovels and seeds to allow the best gardens to be created. * General Store - Fabled Stuff - Sometimes, the other shops just aren't enough. This shop provides what the other shops can't. * Grocery Store - The Old Chestnut - Everybody needs to eat. * Jewellery Store - The Bronze Tiara - There are rings and necklaces and bracelets galore. * Music Shop - Mermaids & Melodies - Everything needed to make a tune can be found here. * Pet Shop - Dragons and Other Household Pets - Aside from fish, this shop only provides pet supplies rather than the actual pets themselves. * Shoe Shop - Old Woman's Shoe House - It'd be uncomfortable walking across the world without any shoes on. * Stationery Store - Quality Quills - Pens and papers and other such things. * Toy Shop - Geppetto's - The widest range of toys that could be imagined, for all the children of the world. * Weaponry Shop - Old Enemies Die Hard - Nobody under the age of 18 is able to access this shop, which is intended to allow the population of the world to protect themselves. Each island also has a museum within its village, where occupants of the world can find a stand with their name upon it. On this stand there will be five objects relating to their life, which they are free to remove from the museum, if they so please."

These include: * A Pot of Gold - Located in the bottom right of the island, there is a pot of gold. From this extends a rainbow, which arches over the island. The rainbow can be followed back to the pot of gold. Unfortunately, the gold is fake, and if stolen, will disappear within twelve hours. * D\u00f9rachd Forest - This is located in the top left of the island. The trees here are always in blossom. When a person is here, they will feel light and happy and be overcome with the urge to sing. * The Memory Room (made by Eva and Wolfie) - At the far right of the island, there is a large, square, empty building that at first looks plain and boring and white, but once someone steps into it, they will see some of the best moments of their life play out around them like a 3D movie. However, if the door shuts behind them, it'll lock for the next hour and some of the worst moments of their life, in the past or future, will play out. * The Snowy Caverns - In the top right of the island, there are a series of snowy caverns. Inside of these it is extremely cold. It is here that the white wolf, protector of the island, lives. Snow falls endlessly here. Somehow, every snowflake is perfect in appearance and won't melt, even if balanced on a fingertip. * The Waterfall Cave - At the bottom of the island, there is a beach with white-golden sand, and just above this there is a miraculous waterfall which does not have a source - it simply flows onto the sand. If a person steps through this water, they will find themselves in a cave, where there are thousands of golden artifacts. The gold, if stolen, will disappear within twelve hours. As well as this, the water washes away magical powers/abilities temporarily, so anybody who steps into the cave will become human while they are there. It is also on this island that the graveyard containing the graves of deceased Worldborns can be found."

    "surface_form": "There are also several unique locations on Olc: * Olc Forest - Located in the top right of Olc, this forest is incredibly different to the one found directly opposite it. The trees here are tall and twisted, and the leaves are so dense, almost no light reaches the forest floor. People will suffer from auditory and visual hallucinations, if they happen to wander in. * The Caves - These dark, moist caves are in the top left of Olc, and are home to the dreaded dragon. Within the caves is an intricate, maze-like system, which may be incredibly difficult to escape from... * The Orchard - Sat on the far left of the island, there is an orchard. Some of the apple trees here are perfectly safe. However, many of them hold poisoned apples. If eaten, the consumer will be rendered unconscious. If within 48 hours, they have not been given a kiss by someone who loves them, the person will die, and will not respawn for a week. The apples can be removed from the orchard and turned into other products, such as pies and juice. * The Shipwreck - At the bottom of the island, if a person were to look over the edge of the huge cliff, they would see a shipwreck, mostly submerged. Pieces of the large wooden ship remain lodged on the rocks, no matter how many times waves crash over them. Although treacherous to try and get to, fascinating objects from other worlds can be found here. * The Wishing Well - At the bottom left of Olc, there is a large lake, with an enormous crocodile lurking in the depths of it. Sitting in the centre of this lake there is a smaller island. On top of this, there is a wishing well. Anyone can make a wish at this well, though it is not guaranteed to come true, or may not come true in the way they were expecting. (Please PM Rhya if you would like to have a character's wish fulfilled somehow)."

There have been a total of 18 Worldborn Children born so far: * Allard Pendragon \u2020 * Gideon Isaiah Joel Martain \u2020 * Jaxon Barrett Winters (died September 2015, resurrected May 2017 as a reward for the Bingo.) * Ava Morgause Gorlois * Matthew Arthur Weasley * Riley Grace Weasley * Isabelle Nicole Fitz-Simmons * Zariah Hope Celestia Holmes * Mason Jay Winters * Braedon Dwaine Gorlois * Zachary Michael Fitz-Simmons * William Sterling Romanov-Holmes * Oscar George Bell-Weasley * Kendra Claire Watson * Alara May Derek * Evie Laurel Queen * Kalina Rose Mikaelson * Genevieve Addison Dare Unlike other characters within the world, world-born children die. Once they die, they don't respawn, they are simply dead forevermore, with no chance of ever returning. Should a child die, their headstone in the graveyard specifically for Worldborn Children is already prepared. In a small building at the graveyard, there are two small pieces of writing to memorialise the two Worldborn Children that have passed away, presented as follows alongside a headshot: Allard Pendragon The son of Guinevere and Arthur Pendragon, Allard was born on August 30th, 2014. He was incredibly handsome, with tanned skin, light brown hair, and green eyes. A sweet, passionate young boy, his loyalty knew no bounds, especially when it came to his aunt-turned-mother-figure, Morgana. He was all but raised by his aunt after his parents both left the world and didn't know either of them particularly well. He later went on to die in her arms after being stabbed by Uther Pendragon on February 8th, 2015. Gideon Isaiah Joel Martain The son of Amber Charlene Martain and the archangel Gabriel, Gideon was born on November 15th, 2014. Taking his dark hair from his mother, he also had honey coloured eyes, and his father's facial structure. He was raised mainly by his mother and grew to be a boy incredibly devoted to his family, which was made up of the people from his parents' world. After getting ill shortly after his mother left the world, Gideon's fever refused to break and killed him on June 12th, 2015. The two boys also have faceclaims (mainly for creating forum related things, like photosets), not identified anywhere in the world: Allard Pendragon: Thomas McDonell Gideon Martain: Torrance Coombs (Pregnancies and stork deliveries can only be accepted by  Rhya  and  Lena . Do not initiate this without asking for permission, because this is a major life event and you will be issued a warning.)"

Alternatively, people incapable of reproduction may suddenly be gifted a child by the world, which would be delivered by a stork. These children are exactly the same as Worldborn children, aside from the fact they will not be genetically related to their parent(s). Therefore, the child could look completely different to them, and may also have entirely different powers, from one of the other worlds. A baby delivered by a stork will be well-swaddled when it is placed on the doorstep of its new family. It will look like a newborn and grow normally, like any other Worldborn. The baby's Magic Mirror will be tucked somewhere within the blanket, which has 'With love' stitched onto it. (The usual rules apply. Requests must be PM'd to Lena or Rhya.)"

    "surface_form": "Characters can be taken from any point after the fixed start date of their fandom - the fixed date could alter depending on the release of further pieces of media. Each fandom has a different date, which can be found in both the Character List and Welcome Topic. Characters will not gain new memories from their universe after the point they have been taken from. * When characters are newly arrived, they have no memory of being in the world before - what happened to them the last time they were in the world is completely irrelevant to a new roleplayer. Other characters may tell them what happened the last time they were in the world. * Characters don't die, they respawn - unless an episode specifies otherwise, or they're a World-Born Child. Their body will be in the same condition as it was when they arrived, but with their memories intact, so if they spend ages getting fit, all their hard work will be undone upon dying. * If a character is ill at the point you took them from, they will remain ill - arriving in the world won't heal them. If you'd rather they weren't sick, take them from a point where they are healthy, or have them healed somehow. Again, if they die, they will respawn ill again. * Characters don't age - even people born within the world have their age frozen eventually. For the duration of their stay in this world, the characters will remain the same age. * Characters can't change life state - as in, they can't become something like a vampire or werewolf. Their entire time in The Convergence, they will be whatever species they were when they arrived. * Characters are the only people in the world - there are no NPCs. Other than themselves, and animals/monsters, the world is like a ghost town. They have to do everything for themselves. Money is irrelevant. Internet, mobiles, and immune systems all function as normal. * The world functions on real-time - meaning the date will always be exactly the same in The Convergence as it is in our world. * Objects like the TARDIS are not in the world - even though the world runs on real-time, the future does not necessarily exist, and therefore things such as the TARDIS and time-turners are not present in it. * Things such as droids or AIs cannot be created within the world - this is because they have the potential to be programmed in such a way that would make them more like actual characters. If somebody attempts to build such a thing, the world will simply fry the systems."

    "surface_form": "Powers and Magic - these effect beings from different fandoms as though they were human beings. By this, it's meant that Avada Kedavra could kill an angel or a demon, or an angel could smite an Original vampire. How powerful the other being is doesn't matter; they will be treated like a human under the effects of another being's magic. * Instant Healing - it is not possible for somebody to be healed instantly and completely, be it by magic or at the touch of an angel. For it to take a few hours is okay, but healing that takes seconds, or no time at all, is not. They could be partly healed, but not completely - this would take longer. * Instant Killing - killing people with a wordless click of the fingers is not possible. Killing somebody must be somehow avoidable - even Avada Kedavra is acceptable, as the spell could be dodged. This is to stop characters being too overpowered. * Bodies - Time Lord regenerations are void in this world, the character would simply die and respawn instead. Angels cannot leave or change vessels. Demons that are actually characters - such as Crowley - can't change who they're possessing. * On Demons - if somebody is being possessed by a demon, as soon as the host dies, the demon won't be in possession of them any more. This is because as soon as a person dies, they respawn."
