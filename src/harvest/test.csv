    "Bella33 Regular Member Joined : Aug 2008 Posts : 490 Posted 1/16/2019 1:17 PM (GMT -7) Had anyone tried cutting the patch in half or quarters? For example would a 2mg become 1mg if it's cut in half or would it stay at 2mg but lasts just 12 hours instead of 24 hours.  My mom is running out of the 1 mg patches and I have 2mg patches that are too strong for her so I tried cutting half per her doctor's ok.  She was sleepy all day long as if she was on the 2mg patch.  Does anyone know why the drug company said do not do it while I have read some people have done it and are fine.",
    "lizzy4451 Forum Moderator Joined : Jun 2005 Posts : 455 Posted 1/16/2019 8:44 PM (GMT -7) Bella, Thanks for your post. I am not on the patch. Whether the medication is delivered in pill form or in a patch form, some medications are not equally distributed throughout.  In this case it could be that more medication is in one area of the patch so when it is cut and applied the part with the excess will be more affected. Clear as mud? But .... your best bet would be to contact your doctor or pharmacist and  ask them. I'm curious to know what they say. You'll have to keep us posted. It will also be interesting to hear from someone using the patch. lizzy4451 Parkinson's Disease Moderator Diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 2001.

    "Bella33 Regular Member Joined : Aug 2008 Posts : 490 Posted 1/16/2019 10:02 PM (GMT -7) The doctor said his other patients do it and it works just the same for them.  The pharmacist goes by what the manufacturer says which is don't do it.   I suppose it depends on the patient's individual sensitivity.  I do agree with what you say though that maybe the medication is not evenly distributed on the patch.",

    "straydog Forum Moderator Joined : Feb 2003 Posts : 17666 Posted 1/17/2019 9:06 AM (GMT -7) Bella, with any extended release medication whether transdermal or oral, the mfg states to never cut a patch or pill in half. When cutting them in half the patient is at risk of either getting too much or too little of the medication. This is why the pharmacist said not to cut it. Sensitivity has nothing to do with this. I would contact her dr & get the proper patch. Take care. Susie Moderator in Chronic Pain & Psoriasis Forums",
    "Bella33 Regular Member Joined : Aug 2008 Posts : 490 Posted 1/17/2019 9:52 AM (GMT -7) Hi Susie, My mom takes time release Stalevo and I have been crushing it for 10 years now. She has a fear of swallowing pills whole so that's the only way I can give it to her.  I heard hospitals and nursing homes do that for people too. She does not respond well to Sinemet or Rytary.   Of course she was better when she was swallowing it but this is as good as it gets and she's still alive. There are people who do not notice a difference when the patches are cut in half so yes I think sensitivity has something to do with it also.   I do have 1 mg patches so I know now in my mom's case she should stick to that.  Thank you for your input."

    "Sugarintheplum Thu 21-Nov-19 10:53:49 Dear All, I am a pregnant black woman, not for the first time, and I'm just wondering about other people's experiences. I've had some very different experiences, some quite stark. In one pregnancy it never really seemed to come up beyond booking and the sickle cell test etc. In another my midwife talked quite openly and a lot about the differences in black and white women's anatomy and how this might impact pregnancy and labour (she herself was European, Italian, I believe). At first,I found it a little disconcerting, my blackness being referenced, but at the same time I appreciated the personalisation and attention to the needs of black women. Ultimately, I was grateful. Oh, and there was the Other time when during a sweep the midwife commented on my baby's lovely black curly hair and I was there, legs open thinking 'seriously, you're ALREADY touching my baby's hair now?!' She told me, for example, that babies of African-descent typically have a shorter gestation period (around 39 weeks) so she'd keep an eye on me if i went overdue (as in 40+ weeks) because in fact my baby would be more overdue than non-black babies and need to be monitored more carefully. Do all midwives even know this? Ad other things like, for example, our pelvis is shaped differently so the baby's exit is different (though the NHS does not accommodate for that in their utensils and tools). So, I'm wondering what other women's experiences are if you are not a white woman, but the NHS and maternity care is modelled on that of white women, and if your baby is not white, but the NHS maternity care is modelled on white babies. Hopefully we ca share some experiences and empower ourselves or others we know when we or they become pregnant in future!",
    "paperplant Thu 21-Nov-19 11:07:27 Following as non-white woman - sounds really interesting, thanks for posting. Can't say much as I've only experienced the booking/sickle cell test and in my hospital we're offered the BCG vaccine as routine. My area is about 50% South Asian ethnicity though.",
    "jennymac31 Thu 21-Nov-19 11:18:01 I've only experienced the booking/sickle cell enquiries and the midwives never made any comments regarding the difference in black and white women's anatomy. Your comment regarding African descent babies having shorter gestation periods is very interesting and probably rang true with both my pregnancies; DC1 arrived at 40+1 weeks but there were complications due to placenta probably stopped growing while DC2 arrived at 39 weeks but ended up in NICU for first 8 hours due ingesting meconium.",
    "Lweji Thu 21-Nov-19 11:27:03 Is that actually true? Anatomy, etc? Have you found evidence other than being told about it by a midwife?",
    "mumwon Thu 21-Nov-19 11:50:12 the one thing I know is true is that if you are of African descent you are far more likely to have twins - academic.oup.com/ije/article/33/1/107/668109 however -I did a search & this came up! interesting because it says exactly what your midwife says!",
    "GrumpyHoonMain Thu 21-Nov-19 12:05:21 black (and some Indian) babies are also more likely to have higher NT thickness (along with a short nose bridge) so scans to spot Downs may not be effective. You can often be advised to go straight for a CVS or NIPT then CVS if you want a risk based result first. My research (mostly American based so may not apply in the UK where a lot black women have African origin) also suggested that the cervical length for some black women is shorter due to hip shape which is what causes early labour, and that black women are also more likely to have this (and thus have smaller babies). However the NHS doesn\u2019t tend to offer routine screening for this unless you had a problem with this previously. Also black / Indian woman are more likely to get gestational diabetes and preclampsia and so have smaller bump size / baby size tolerances. And less likely to have babies with certain genetic problems (cystic fybrosis for example). But all of that applies to women who aren\u2019t mixed race. If you are mixed race nobody should be using race based models with you - they should be treating you individually. My guess is your previous midwives treated you like a black mum to be to be on the safe side and ensure you get extra monitoring earlier (as I said earlier smaller tolerances for any problems).",
    "brightbird Thu 21-Nov-19 12:06:06 I have read about the pelvis shape one when I was in my madly-researching-everything phase in early pregnancy.",
    "JayDot500 Thu 21-Nov-19 12:09:26 DH and I are black, but he's Black British/Nigerian and I'm Black British/Caribbean. He has Sickle Cell (although he's very healthy, thank God), so I was fully tested for sickle cell by his hospital staff before we were even married. We were told black African babies tend to be bigger, but not by a midwife, but this tends to be a cultural belief. Our son was not a big baby. He was closer to my own birth weight, but DH's sisters all had big babies and most of their DC were overdue. DS was only a day overdue. Re anatomy, I'd want to see evidence. I have cousins with big hips but they actually have a small pelvis which became problematic during birth. So basically, nothing to report. I have an amazing Irish midwife, who is rather senior and has been a midwife for decades. She would have told me anything I should have known if it were important. She told me DS would be tested for Sickle Cell, and that he'd be offered the BCG.",
    "NellWilsonsWhiteHair Thu 21-Nov-19 12:15:04 If you are mixed race nobody should be using race based models with you - they should be treating you individually. - I was wondering about this recently. My sister is pregnant and midwife has recommended she has the GTT due to ethnicity (mixed white/Black Caribbean), and I wondered how much of a robust breakdown there really is for the stats on these sorts of things. I am white, but my children are half-African, and nobody ever mentioned the shorter gestation thing to me - they were born at 39+6 and 38+5. Midwife for my second was convinced I would go overdue and started offering me a sweep, quite insistently, from 38 weeks.",
    "BertieBotts Thu 21-Nov-19 12:17:37 I'm not black, but one issue I've heard about is Mongolian blue spots, this is a kind of birthmark which is more common in darker-skinned babies. Unfortunately it looks like bruising and there have been cases of HCPs not being aware of this and parents accused of child abuse before the truth comes out. So it is worth being aware of it and if your baby has it being prepared to explain about the condition to health professionals. There can also be a problem with spotting jaundice in babies with non-white skin tones - they should be looking at the whites of the eyes if unsure.",
    "GrumpyHoonMain Thu 21-Nov-19 12:18:09 @NellWilsonsWhiteHair - the GTT scan is based on the risk for black women I would bet as half white / half Indian women also have to have the GTT scan (and some even get offered proactive preclampsia treatment) due to the risk for Indian women.",
    "GrumpyHoonMain Thu 21-Nov-19 12:20:50 Mongolian blue spots often get checked for after birth but can be difficult to see on darker skinned babies, or emerge later. This is another reason why it\u2019s a good idea to stay for an extra night in the hospital if possible.",
    "Sugarintheplum Thu 21-Nov-19 13:33:01 Hi All, Wow, a lot of responses in short period. I'm learning. I'm currently pregnant so will look more into tests for Downs being less accurate. I find so much of this stuff frustrating. The information should be more readily available. Re pelvis size etc being true - I think they covered this in the Woman's Hour on Black Maternal Health recently: www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006zlb Hopefully there will be more responses and we can share more between us. This will be my last pregnancy, I expect, so I'll be passing all of this info on. About shorter gestation period, yes. I track my ovulation so I'm pretty sure of O date, and each pregnancy they have put me forward 4 or 5 days by 12 week scan, when there is no way. I also had babies on the small-ish side (6 or just 7 lbs) so talk about black babies being bigger I expect is a more stereotype... Both of my babies had Mongolian blue spots, my 2 year old is just losing hers on her face. There is also vit D deficiency which can result in what looks like bruises etc on babies, when it's not. This happens to white mums too, but lack of vit D is a definite issue for darker skinned women.",
    "Sugarintheplum Thu 21-Nov-19 13:34:47 @jennymac31 \"DC1 arrived at 40+1 weeks but there were complications due to placenta probably stopped growing while DC2 arrived at 39 weeks but ended up in NICU for first 8 hours due ingesting meconium.\" They really should have been monitoring closer. You can't be alone in this.",
    "Sugarintheplum Thu 21-Nov-19 13:36:45 oooh, sorry, and about shorter gestation periods. This also means black babies are more likely to survive when born prematurely, because they have matured their organs quicker. But on the other side, yes, far greater risks when overdue.",
    "Honeybee85 Thu 21-Nov-19 13:43:27 I\u2019m caucasian but had a mixed baby (half Asian) in an Asian country. My body type is also very different from Asian women, for example I had gained much more weight then the average Asian pregnant woman and my baby was also bigger. Doctor openly discuss differences between pregnancies in women from different ethnicities with me (for example told me that Caucasian women had a wider pelvic bone opening then Asian women) and assured me that despite my more then average weight gain , I didn\u2019t look fat to him so he said it was OK. My advice to you would be to speak up if you have questions or feel uncomfortable re how your pregnancy is treated based on you being Black and just enjoy it and not worry too much",
    "BreadSauceHmm Thu 21-Nov-19 13:45:10 I usually read on here babies being described as 'underweight' at around the 5 pound mark although IME that's quite normal for Asian babies and have been told by midwives as such. I was automatically selected for GTT despite having no family history and TB jab despite having hardly any family abroad (baby is 4th generation British Indian) or planning to visit India. Only ethnic minorities are offered TB jab in my area regardless of history.",
    "Lweji Thu 21-Nov-19 14:40:17 I also found this article that seems to suggest there's some truth to the anatomy differences. But the study was done on African Americans. www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2593128/ The thing is that there isn't one \"black race\". Genetically, Africans vary a lot. What may be true for the African Americans tested may well not apply to many black women. There's also something called ecological fallacy. It means that we shouldn't treat individuals like the group they belong to. More so because of mixed ancestries. So, every woman should be evaluated on her own, not according to her \"race\" - meaningless term.",
    "girlanonymous Thu 21-Nov-19 15:13:15 Don't know if this is relevant but DS was very jaundiced (not sure of that's a word, but you know what I mean) and they ignored it thinking it was just his skin tone. I'm South Asian, but he's mixed and I knew his colouring was way too yellowish in tone. They ignored this, and a week later had to back in after I had him and his bilirubin levels were high. Also the BCG vaccine was brought up.",
    "Sugarintheplum Thu 21-Nov-19 15:42:42 @Llewi , Agreed that race is a social construct. Every woman should have the size of their pelvis assessed, along with the shape of their birth canal, and there certainly are some white people out there with sickle cell, and some African babies with cystic fibrosis etc... My understanding is that if a particular condition or issue does not crop up often outside of a pretty narrow model of pregnant woman based on white British women, it's not often fully considered in our NHS. This is not even really considering how some women feel ignored, or overlooked, or treated badly because of their culture, which I've also heard a lot about. Racism is everywhere, no reason to think it does not crop up in medical research on expectant women, or in their eventual treatment in antenatal and maternal care.",
    "Lweji Thu 21-Nov-19 15:53:29 Racism is everywhere, no reason to think it does not crop up in medical research on expectant women, or in their eventual treatment in antenatal and maternal care. Indeed it does.",
    "BuildBuildings Thu 21-Nov-19 16:02:45 The woman's hour was really quite upsetting in places. I'm not a parent and white so don't want to dominate the thread. This made me think of my sister's experience recently. Her husband is Indian and they couldn't seem to get their head around the fact the baby was small because Indian babies tend to be small so because the baby was mixed race it might be small. Also the baby had jaundice which was missed because the baby has dark skin. So I can't imagine if little things like this seem to be beyond maternity care then what the experience of black women is. Obviously the women's hour programme gave me an idea. Thanks for sharing your experiences I've learned things I didn't know. Which make the uniform care even more shocking.",
    "BuildBuildings Thu 21-Nov-19 16:05:27 My sisters other child had Mongolian blue spot and hardly anyone knew what it was and just thought it was a bruise!",
    "goodnightsugarpop Thu 21-Nov-19 17:23:25 this is a really interesting & useful thread, thank you @Sugarintheplum ! do you ladies think the level of knowledge & understanding of these issues varies depending on where you live? I live in north London and I guess I'd assumed if my baby or pregnancy needed any specific knowledge due to the baby's ethnic mix (I'm white, baby's dad is South Asian) then this would be the place to be because most of the babies being born at my local hospital must be Black, Asian or mixed! So presumably the midwives are experienced and wouldn't be thrown off by things like birthmarks/jaundice presenting differently in darker skinned babies...?? I was recommended that my baby get the TB jab when they're born but I was under the impression that everyone gets offered it in London especially in less privileged neighbourhoods.",

    "Liebe Idefix, stimmt, in der Onkologie hat Dexamethason einen sehr guten Ruf, siehe auch hier: https://www.onkologie-partner.de/...t#dexamethason Wahrscheinlich sind nur die deutschen Neuros fixiert auf ihr ultrahochdosiertes (Methyl)Prednisolon, weil sie sich noch 27 Jahre nach der Ver\u00f6ffentlichung im NEJM an die fehlerhafte Becksche Optikusneuritis-Studie klammern. Darin sehen sie ihre Legitimation f\u00fcr ihre Overkill-Dosen. Es gibt auch irgendwo eine pseudo-wissenschaftliche Begr\u00fcndung daf\u00fcr, dass man zur Schubbehandlung die hohen Grammdosen verwendet, aber die habe ich vergessen. Mein erstes Cortison habe ich mit ~16 vom Allergologen bekommen. Tatsache ist, dass Hormone (wie Cortisonpr\u00e4parate) in unserem K\u00f6rper in winzigen Mengen (in Milligramm-Dosen) wirken. Tatsache ist aber auch, dass selbst eine \u00dcberdosis nicht t\u00f6dlich ist. Von welchem Medikament kann man das Hundertfache der Normaldosis nehmen, ohne daran zu sterben? Die geradezu hysterische Angst mancher Anwender vor Cortisonpr\u00e4paraten ist ebenso unbegr\u00fcndet wie ihr lockerer Umgang mit gef\u00e4hrlichen rezeptfreien NSAR wie Aspirin oder Thomapyrin, an denen j\u00e4hrlich mehrere Tausend PatientInnen versterben ( https://www.aerzteblatt.de/...rtalitaet-durch-NSAR ). An den Cortison-Grammdosen der Neurologenbranche sterben die wenigsten PatientInnen, obwohl sie's bei mir vielleicht geschafft h\u00e4tten, mit 4 x 500 mg Solu-Decortin H (i.v. Prednisolon) ohne Kaliumsubstitution bei meinem Diagnose-Schub. Sie hatten wohl das \"Cave\" in der Pr\u00e4parate-Info nicht gelesen, worin vor der Hypokali\u00e4mie gewarnt wird. Das einzige Argument, das die Neuros gegen Dexamethason bringen, ist, dass  es zu einer Steroidmyopathie f\u00fchren kann. Diese ist eine Folge der Einnahme von hohen Cortisondosen, oder von deren Anwendung \u00fcber l\u00e4ngere Zeit. Das gilt aber f\u00fcr alle Glucocorticoide, nicht nur f\u00fcr Dexamethason. Ich erinnere mich, vor ein paar Jahren einen Artikel gelesen zu haben, in dem eine Steroidmyopathie speziell mit Dexamethason in Zusammenhang gebracht wurde. Was aber nicht haltbar war. Bei den Beckschen Overkill-Dosen habe ich noch keine Warnung vor einer Steroidmyopathie gelesen, und bei dem immer noch nicht ganz abgeschafften \"Ausschleichen\" auch nicht. Meine Argumente, warum die Becksche Optikus-Neuritis-\"Studie\" keine solche war, habe ich schon x-mal angef\u00fchrt. Selbst W.W. hat es irgendwann gerafft. Es wurden unverblindet zwei verschieden starke Cortisone gegeneinander getestet, was hat das mit einer \"Studie\" zu tun. Nichts. Beck wollte mit der \"Studie\" nur Reklame f\u00fcr die Firma machen, die er im Jahr darauf gr\u00fcndete, das \"Jaeb Center for Health Research\" in Tampa, Fla., das kommerziell Studien durchf\u00fchrt. Und diese Werbe-\"Studie\" beten vor allem die deutschen Neuros seit \u00fcber 25 Jahren kritiklos nach. Liegt diese Autorit\u00e4tsgl\u00e4ubigkeit im deutschen Wesen? Liebe Gr\u00fc\u00dfe Renate",

I\u0092m convinced I have MS but at the moment my doctors aren\u0092t taking me very seriously because I\u0092m not showing lesions on MRI. They are treating me for other things but don\u0092t think they are MS related. To start off with I\u0092ll just list what I have been diagnosed with. Epileptiform discharges originally diagnosed as frontal lobe seizures bilateral trigeminal neuralgial balance issues I\u0092m working with the PT with. That\u0092s all they\u0092ve been able to find I\u0092ve had what I believe was spasticity over a decade ago in all four limbs that lasted for 4 days. I\u0092ve had periods of brain fog and severe fatigue that lasts about a week. About 4 years ago I had ataxia and went to the hospital did an MRI and it was clear. Doctor said it was stress. My memory progressively got worse during these years to where I forgot appointments and obligations. Two years ago I suspected I might have MS and sought help from a neuro. She did all sorts of tests on me and concluded I did not have MS. Some weeks later I developed vertigo, slurred speech, clumsiness, and blurred vision. I went back to the neuro and she thought I had a stroke. Did another MRI and it was clear. Long story short she suggested it could have been seizures or a TIA with no clear diagnosis. Right now I\u0092m getting a second opinion from another neuro but it\u0092s pretty slow moving. It\u0092s been a pretty frustrating journey so far. Has anyone been through something similar?",

Sounds like you have found answers for some conditions and are hanging by the limbs on other symptoms. I'm sorry to hear - it must be very frustrating. I have had vertigo and spasticity (still do), but nothing else that you describe. Oops, memory problems too, but that also comes with aging -lol. Good luck with your next neuro appt. Is this neuro an MS specialist? Hope you can get to the bottom of all your problems! MS is hard to diagnose, in that they rule out other conditions first. Please take care and let us know what your next appt. finds, if anything. 1st sx '89 Dx '99 w/RRMS - now SP w/o flares Administrator Message Boards/Moderator",
    "04-07-2019, 12:52 AM #3 Crazyguy View Profile View Forum Posts Join Date Dec 2017 Location USA Posts 23 To my knowledge he is not an MS specialist. Not even sure if my area has one close by. He\u0092s done an EMG on my left leg, an EEG to check for seizures, and a sleep study for the same. My wife has told me my legs shake while I\u0092m sleeping for about 5-7 seconds at a time. He seems to think that I have restless legs syndrome even though it went away when they started me on the seizure meds for the TN. I feel like I\u0092m talking to a wall when I bring up MS because he won\u0092t even entertain the possibility since I\u0092m not showing lesions. The sleep study only only showed that I have sleep apnea. They want me to come in for a second study to test a cpap. The weird thing is that they didn\u0092t make me stop the seizure meds to do these tests. I cant help but feel I\u0092m getting inadequate care. I\u0092ve though even I\u0092ve told them my previous psychiatrist suggested that I might have a neurologic disease.",

Unfortunately my doctors are standing firm on the no MS thing and haven\u0092t been able to convince them to give me a LP. There is no single test, by it's self, that can give a diagnosis of MS.  For this reason MS can be difficult to diagnose. A LP is usually one of the last tests to be given as it is quite invasive and a negative LP does not rule MS out. As I said in an earlier post the diagnostic criteria relies heavily on MRI evidence and since you don't have lesions the medical thought is you don't have MS, so why do an invasive? (right or wrong).  Lesions are a hallmark of this disease, however not all lesions are MS type lesions. Other conditions can cause lesions. Here is a link to some of those other conditions that mimic MS: https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Sy...ns-to-Rule-Out If you did not have a spine MRI done then I would suggest asking the Neurologist about doing one.  MS is a disease of the Central Nervous System(CNS), which includes the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. Lesions can and do show up anywhere within the CNS.  I would suggest the spine MRI before even doing a LP.

Dont worry, I didn\u0092t take offense to your post. I know not showing lesions means it\u0092s a slim chance that I do have MS. The main reason I believe I do have it is that my mom has MS. I know it sounds crazy but I think I\u0092ve had it since I was a kid. Ive had a psychotic disorder since I was 18. I\u0092ve read that early onset MS can cause seizures and normal exams as well as psychotic disorders. When I was 10 I used to get intense stomach pain that my GP couldn\u0092t figure out. In my teens I used to sleep all day and couldnt get out of bed. One time I thought I had pancreatitis cause of these pains and could even keep water down for a week. I guessing this could be from a lesion on my brain stem controlling my stomach. I also remember going camping with friends when I was 16 and they told me my legs shook in my sleep. I agree that there are more tests they could have done like evoked potentials. This neuro I\u0092m seeing is supposed to be a pretty good one. I just hope he can find something.",

Does anyone know anything about this? Hi Crazyguy Here is some info from the NMSS website about MRI: \"The strength of the magnet used in the MRI machine is important to the quality of the images. Magnet strength is measured in Tesla (T). Most conventional MRI machines are 1.5T or 3T. Open MRIs are usually less than 1.5T and do not provide the best images for detecting MS activity, although they may be used when someone has difficulty tolerating a closed MRI machine. MRI machines used for research purposes have much higher magnet strength.\" https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Sy...-Diagnosis/MRI Take Care PPMS for 21 years (dx 1998) ~ Worrying will not take away tomorrow's troubles ~  But it will take away today's peace.  ~",

I would suggest you see a Orthopedic Spine Dr./Surgeon  Herniated discs can cause neurological symptoms but is not related to MS, and should be evaluated by a Orthopedic Spine Dr./Surgeon. We haven\u0092t imaged my whole spine though. Don\u0092t know if that matters. It matters because you already have one herniated disc and there could be more spine problems.

    "I have not been diagnosed yet with MS.\u00a0 I have had the bad MRI on Nov. 4th.\u00a0 The written report was pages long but my internal medicine doctor didnt understand part of it.\u00a0 He referred me to a nurologists.\u00a0 They called and the earliest appointment was December 31.\u00a0 I questioned them being open. That was the earlist available. They called about a week later and needed to reschedule and now the earlist available is January 28th. I wasnt thrilled with the appointment at the end of December.\u00a0 I am stressed with worry.\u00a0 I understand there is a shortage of doctors and I am really not okay with waiting till the end of January for an appointment. Am I just acting like a crazy person and this is how it works when your talking about appointments with nurologists?\u00a0 Are the nurological issues not of a impact where waiting several monthes for an appointment could be detrimential?",
    "Waiting is difficult, I was lucky in that I was able to schedule mine so it happened in time for when my brain MRI results reached his office. I think I was also lucky in that my diagnosis came within like a few months following my initial relapse symptom. The results of spinal tap really confirmed it for my neurologist. My best advice to you is to remain as calm as possible and if you feel you can't or really don't wish to wait it out, perhaps call around or look online for other neurologists in your area. I wish you well and hope you get the information & appointment you need soon.",
    "Maybe call the internal medicine doctor and see about getting a referral to another neurologist. Also see if you can get acid with the MRI results to take to your appointment. Most important try to manage your stress and not freak out as that can make things worse.",
    "Hello mechelles, You may want to ask them if they have a cancellation list and will call you if someone cancels their appointment. You can use this link to find other neurologists in your area that may have an earlier appointment. Below are some links that may also be helpful for you as you go through this process: Possible MS Diagnosing MS You are welcome to call us at 1.800.344.4867 if you have additional questions. Best, Stephanie, MS Navigator",
    "Thank you for the responses. I also realize that I had a need to vent and coming here allowed me to vent and avoid Facebook.\u00a0 Thank you. I did ask the doctors office to put me on a call in list for cancellations. I did call my internal medicine doctor and ask if he could make another referral.\u00a0 The first referral was to a Dr. close by.\u00a0 I stated in my message I was willing to travel.\u00a0 I live dead center on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.\u00a0 Its not uncommon for people here to travel to New Orleans La or Mobile Al for care. I am going to go to the listing of doctors and make some calls.\u00a0 To be honest I had always thought since these doctors needed a referral to see you that the would be reluctant to deal with you. I guess one of the reasons this delay is bothering me is that my internal medicine doctor mentioned that if I didnt get seen timely, I would probable need another MRI after 6 weeks.\u00a0 On the MRI report the only thing really written in plain english was at the end where he recommended another MRI after 6 weeks.\u00a0 \u00a0I will probably call my Internal medicine doctor after the 6 wwek mark.\u00a0 My hope is he will order another MRI giving a comparison for the nurologists to look after. I am going to read up on MRI and acid Again...thank you all.",
    "You can call them back and ask to be put on a call list for canceled appointments if you want to get in sooner with the holidays someone might cancel their appointment and you can get in sooner that way. Sorry didn't see that you got on a wait list. But I hope that you can stick with a Dr near you because if your MS gets worse and can't handle driving or riding that far then it might help to have one near."

    "By reluctantcare On 2019.08.03 15:35 How do you deal with giving up driving?  My husband has been cited by our condo management company for his reckless driving and last night he hit a neighbor's car.  Another neighbor immediately took photos and sent them to that neighbor and said she would file a police report.  My husband's doctors encouraged him to take a safe driving program but he refused.  I don't drive and rely on public transit, senior ride shares and Lyfts, but he is not open to any of those options.  I am afraid he might actually lose his license soon and was wondering how others have coped with a loved one with PD losing their driver's license.",
    "By lurkingforacure On 2019.08.03 22:17 Wait-you're afraid he might lose his license soon?  Seriously?  It does not sound like he should be driving. At all. He has been cited for reckless driving already. He continues driving, and has now hit a neighbor's car. A police report is being filed. You need to think about the lawsuit that will be filed at some point by whoever your husband hits next who might not be so forgiving.  What if he hits a child and renders them paralyzed for life, or worse? Could you live with that guilt? Could he?  Have you all talked about this possibility/probability? We all will lose the ability to drive at some point and all of us will have to deal with it.  Losing that independence stinks, more for some than others.  But the safety and well-being of others on the roads and sidewalks trumps your husband's unhappiness at not being able to drive. I'm sorry if I sound mean.  But if your husband won't take the advice of his doctor, that is telling.  He thinks he knows better than his doctor?  That will be great evidence in the lawsuit that's filed when he next hits something/someone. I feel very strongly about this issue and have posted here about it before, as have others. It's not an easy issue. You might want to search the forum for those posts--there are quite a few. Good luck",
    "By VioletV On 2019.08.03 22:30 reluctant...I'll add that some have said that if a PWP has been told he should not drive, but does so anyway, then his insurance will not cover an accident. If he damages property or god forbid injures or kills someone, then he can be sued and lose everything. If for no other reason than to protect your assets, please take his keys away and inform the state DMV. VV",
    "By reluctantcare On 2019.08.04 16:50 Thank you all for your replies. He had another accident today hitting a car coming out of a parking lot and wound up going with a third party to pay an exorbitant amount to get it fixed and keep the insurance company out of it.  I have a feeling that the condo management company will inform the state DMV.  I suggested today that he give up driving, but he said he would rather die.  The problem is that he could kill someone else and he just doesn't care.",
    "By lurkingforacure On 2019.08.04 19:38 Your last post made me lose my mind!  Your husband \"just doesn't care\" if he hurts or kills someone with his driving?  Oh, boy. You may want to talk with an attorney about what liability/responsibility you may have as his wife if you don't take steps to stop him from driving.  I'm not talking money, either, although I hope you all have lots of it because it sounds like you may need it when, not if, something else happens. I'm talking criminal liability, where you might face jail time.  Think about that, for both you and your husband.  I can see the argument being made that it is criminally negligent for you to not take active steps to keep your husband from driving under the circumstances you have described. And I think, just my opinion, that it is criminally negligent, perhaps grossly so, for him to continue driving when he knows his illness has progressed to the point that he is having these accidents (although I wouldn't call them accidents because most accidents are things that you could not have predicted or expected). Perhaps your husband should go to see an attorney with you, so that he understands what he is risking by continuing to drive, for the both of you.",
    "By reluctantcare On 2019.08.05 15:47 Oh, yes, he said this in the neurologist's office a couple months ago.  Frankly, I'm surprised that neither his primary care, neurologist or cardiologist hasn't reported him yet because they all advised against him driving until he took a Safe Driving Program, which he adamantly refused to do. He would not even consider going to an attorney with me because he is in such a complete state of denial about his condition.  He refers to it as a minor inconvenience. Did I mention that he is a recovering alcoholic who only stopped drinking when he was diagnosed with congestive heart failure? For all I know, his years of drinking could have caused his PD.  I was considering reporting him to the DMV, but it won't be considered anonymous in our state. Last year after his subdural hematoma his daughter took the car so he couldn't drive it and he was the nastiest, vilest human being full of vitriol every day he wasn't able to drive.  His daughter finally caved to his bullying and gave him the car back. If he ever finds out I reported him, he will make my life even more miserable than it already is living with him. I'm sorry if I sound so defensive but he is such a complete narcissist that he refuses to consider how his actions impact others.  Your advice is very sound, but he is not playing with a full deck.

To be able to live with myself when my impaired husband insisted on driving, he took a test with an OT, who suggested some restrictions.  That let me morally off the hook (in my mind).  Finally a physician friend whom we vacationed with and who observed my husband\u0092s functioning in general for a week told him in no uncertain terms he was not good to drive. It\u0092s been over a year now.  Your husband probably will survive it.  Also, give your auto insurance company a call.  Maybe they can help",

I began taking artane about 8 years ago and it made all the difference in the world for my ability to see. The spasms better controlled and as a result I was able to go back to work. I also had much more energy to do things. The drawbacks from the medication were the dry mouth and constipation and surprisingly muscle stiffness. I also have problems with my short term memory. My tolerance level was also much lower than the recommended dose. Despite the negative effects, I still found that it was worth taking because it allowed me to function better than anything else I had tried. I would recommend the medication to anyone with dystonia who has a problem with either antro or retrocolis or benign essential blepharospasm. It really made a difference to me.\" 3 likes",

Author information 1 Unit\u00e0 Operativa di Neurologia, Azienda Ospedaliera di Verona, Verona, Italy. micheletinazzi@libero.it Abstract Manipulation of afferent inputs may temporarily modulate dystonic spasms. Ten patients with writer's cramp were enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study in which the effects of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) and placebo treatment were compared. Patients were evaluated using four measures of dystonic impairment. The TENS group showed a significant improvement that persisted for 3 weeks in three of the four measures. PMID: 15955950 DOI: 10.1212/01.WNL.0000163851.70927.7E [Indexed for MEDLINE] ------------------------ Posted July 13, 2014 I at first used the word external TENS unit, and it worked well. The physician thought the internal stimulator might work better. So myself, along with my pain specialist, and neurologist all did research on it. We found that one gentleman in Great Britain had it done, but never returned. So we all got together with a plan and performed the surgery. It took about 4-4.5 hours. A stimulator was placed and the leads were put in place (a max of 4 were used) and each lead had 4 contacts. The contracts were placed on the muscles that had the most dystonia. Needless to say, it is still under study and the unit has never been turned off except for the first 2 visits. I know I would be in a wheelchair now if it were not for the stimulator. I say to give the TENS a try and go from there. ------------------------------ Dr. Okun Posted June 9, 2014 So far I have not been very impressed with TENS unit for treatment of PD dystonia or pain.

For anything else, then you'll need to get a benefits check from an advice centre near you because claiming a means tested benefit will depend on circumstances. https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay PIP maybe possible but it's not awarded based on a diagnosis, it's how those conditions affect your ability to carry out daily activity based on the PIP descriptors. Evidence will be needed to support a claim, which should state how your conditions affect you. https://www.turn2us.org.uk/Benefit-guides/Personal-Independence-Payment/What-is-PIP",

COPD affects many people in different ways and if managed well does not necessarilly have a huge impact on how you live your life. Depending on what your job is there maybe reasonable adjustments that can be made to help you stay in work. Rather than look to the benefit system ( which is no fun to have to live on ) Talk to your GP and your employer to help you manage your condition. If you have a community respiritory taem in your area, ask for a referal as they can and do help with specialised knowledge Be all you can be, make\u00a0 every day count. Namaste"

    "Hi, and sorry you are ill. Well, norovirus usually goes away on its own within about a few days. So, it may be bacterial or even a parasite. If you haven't had a culture done you should have one done. Have you eaten out a lot or at a friends house or family over the holidays? Did anyone else get sick? Your potassium would have to be extremely low (below about 2.7) for it to cause Afib but it is possible. You need to get in to a doctor since you are still sick and get your electrolytes checked and if you are low get an iV. The organism that you acquired isn't causing the AFIb it would be the low potassuim or possibly someother root cause that the diarrhea is just making worse.",
    "Maybe I had norovirus. The illness has gone away, and I feel good, even better than in the whole December. My husband had mild fever and some discomfort in his stomach but no diarrhea. On 17 January I ordeded measurements of\u00a0\u00a0Na+, CRP, leukocyte count, ALAT and amylase. I have not yet got the results (they will be posted to me).",
    "Yes Norovirus is self limiting it by your symptoms and duration of illness. It can also have variable symptoms as seen by your husbands symptoms. I'm glad you are over it.\u00a0\u00a0Your results will probably be normal except your potassium , maybe your sodium . I doubt your amylase will be off as that is more typical of pancreatitis. take care, mkh9",
    "Thanks. I wanted to have amylase measured, because I had upper abdominal pain on several days in December. Because I have hyperparathyroidism, pancreatitis could be possible. I have some cysts in my pancreas and liver. I had occasional diarrhea attacks from January 6 before the more severe diarrhea on 13-15(16) January. Such slow onset is not typical of norovirus. I have often high sodium (in Emergency unit on 6 January 146 when upper normal limit 144) but always normal potassium.",
    "Hi, well it is good you are getting the amylase checked. You might want to get the lipase checked too. But do you know why you have the cysts? Have they tested the stool for parasites? Just\u00a0\u00a0wondering if there is a link between the abdominal pain, cysts and diarrhea? you are totally correct, norovirus doesn't have a slow onset. mkh9",
    "There may have been other causes before the onset of the norovirus diarrhea. In an MRI for parathyroids, a year ago, there was seen an infiltration in the upper part of my left lung. Then I had also an MRI of upper abdomen, where a few small liver and pancreatic cysts were seen. The lung infiltration (8-9 mm) has been followed, and the last TT will be in April of this year. It has not grown. There are also a couple of 2 mm infiltrations. The infiltrations do not cause symptoms. I have read that small cysts in the liver and pancreas are very common and insignificant. I had endoscopic cholecystectomia in late 2010. Just previously, ALAT was slightly elevated. Now it is possible that some adhesions have grown in the area. A few years ago I had a stool test (negative). The chronic left side sinusitis bothers me. It becomes active several times a year. Discharge from the left sinuses is minimal, but I have slight pain in my left cheek, temporal or forehead area. I do have tough post-nasal drip in the mornings throughout the year. In my neck, on the left side, there is a lymph node, which can be seen when I bend my neck to the right. I don't know what is the cause of my sinusitis. Previously, when I was at work, I handled wild fishes and clams. I have a faint idea, whether I could have an actinomycete or aspergillus in my sinus. A FESS operation was sometimes planned but then decieded not to do it, because my symptoms are so slight (not plenty of snot). The post-nasal discharge sometimes makes my pharynx sore when I try to swallow it. Could it infect my stomach or intestines?",
    "I have an enlarged cervical lymph node at the jugular area. It was 17 mm in length in 2010. Now it may have grown, because bending ny neck to the left is slightly difficult. And I have some dysphagia and white mucus (post nasal drip?) down in my pharynx (left side). I have chronic sinusitis. No runing nose. Has the node grown now due to norovirus or chronic sinusitis? Yesterday a doctor said that I may have haemoglobinopathy (small and pale red cells, high red cell count). My leukocyte count has not increased.",
    "That is a large lymph node. I still wonder about a parasite especially since you handled fish.Raw fish can have several parasites, but usually tapeworms. It depends on where you were working and where the fish came from or migrated to and from.If the diarrhea was caused by a bacteria then it is possible it made your lymph nodes in your neck area swell more. Sinusitis is often caused by Staphlycoccus aureus, but can be caused by Aspergillus sp. Hopefully, it is just a Staph. I have had a sinusitis too and it is usually dry and crusty. I used steam (head over a hot bowl of steam) and antibiotics to get rid of it. Do they know why your cervical lymph node is large? A hemaglobinopathy is a general term. It is not saying what the actual problem/cause is. Maybe he is still trying to figure it out. It could be due to an anemia..Keep me posted ok? mkh9",
    "The diarrhea which I had was a typical norovirus diarrhea, but there was something else before it, maybe due to stress caused by atrial fibrillation. Many people have had norovirus here. I had today an ultrasound study on my neck. There were two lymph nodes near each other on the left side. They looked normal. There was nothing pathologic in my neck. Because I have had dysphagia during a couple of days, the cause may be in my pharynx, some oedema or extra mucus. There is really white mucus often in the left side of my pharynx. It may come from the left tonsilla or from the left sinuses. The cause of my sinusitis is not known, It has\u00a0\u00a0lasted from from the end of 2009. Antibiotics do not work for it. I use nasal cortisone to shrink the swollen epithelium of the ostia. The fish with which I worked years ago were local fish from Finland, and they had their typical parasites, including microscopic species. I have not eaten raw fish and can't have tapeworms. I had lab tests today: Mycoplasma and hemoglobin variants. Someone here had Mycoplasma sinusitis. The doctor a couple of days ago said that I may have a slight mutation of a haemoglobin gene. It is not thalassemia. I have good total hemoglobin, erythrocyte count and soluble transferrin receptor. But my red cells are slightly smaller and paler than normal. I think that my chronic sinusitis might also cause small and pale red cells.",
    "Ok, I thought you were looking for an answer to what type of diarrhea you had. It does sound like norovirus. The states are getting a lot of it this year too.You could have had Shigella too but usually you don't get both. Glad your lymph nodes were normal. I didn't know you could get sinusitis caused by Mycoplasma. Usually, you get \"walking pneumonia\". It sounds like they are making progress in finding out what is causing your red cells to be microcytic. I hope that you can feel better soon. mkh9",
    "Now I am on an antibiotic (Doximycin) due to sinus infection. Mycoplasma antibodies were not very high, IgG 194 and IgM negative. Thus it may not be Mycoplasma. I have fever.",
    "Now I may have laryngitis. This flu has lasted about two weeks. I have lost my voice and have difficulties in respiration. I have successive infections almost all the year round.",
    "You may mean Doxycycline or maybe they have a different name for it. You may have a different organism cause the sinusitits and the respiratory organism may be the mycoplasma along with a virus. The mycoplasma usually comes out when people have a long term viral infection and get run down. It seems this year people are getting multiple viruses in a row one after another. Usually, you have one virus and you may relapse and get the same one back. Then your immune system kicks in and you don't get another virus but may get a secondary bacterial like mycoplasma. This year I think the viruses are more virulent and they are causing something to happen to people immunity or there are just a lot of very virulent virses out there. My sister in law had a bad virus then she got the norovirus (stomach bug) then she got a flu like bug with a high fever. She had been sick since Christmas. I hope you feel better soon. Regarding the Mycoplasma antibiodies if your IgM is negative then it isn't a recent infection, the igG is showing that you were exposed to it but it was more than a month ago and perhaps was a long time ago. If you have a fever take it easy and try to drink fluids while you can. take care, mkh9"

    "A positive ANA just means you have inflammation. The DNA being negative rules out Lupus which they look for with a positive ANA. I had a positive ANA and a very strong LP which told the Doctors I had a lot of inflammation. My DNA was negative plus I had no symptoms of Lupus. They have to take tests and symptoms and match them for a diagnosis. MS is mostly a diagnosis of exclusion of all other diseases. Alex",
    "The positive ANA may likely mean nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Many healthy people have a low positive titer like 1:32 or 1:64.\u00a0\u00a0People with real inflammatory disease almost always have a very high ANA titer (as high or higher than 1:320) MS is NOT statstically associated with positive ANA titers.\u00a0\u00a0Period. People with MS may have low-positive ANA's, just as people in the general population can have them. To clarify what Alex said, the ANA is a marker for some Inflammatory Diseases, but is not a marker for inflammation itself, like the Sed Rate or the CRP (C-Reactive Protein). Quix",
    "Thank You. Please Take Care, Theresa",
    "I've had low titer ANAs 1:80 along with some other indicators that inflammation was going on (C-reactive protein and elevated sed. rate).\u00a0\u00a0Were other tests like these run on you and were they positive? Looking back, I think the explanation for all three tests to be slightly abnormal was that something autoimmune was going on.\u00a0\u00a0For me, I think it was the thyroid problem that I was diagnosed years later after the initial symptoms, but I'll never know for sure.",
    "Hi, I know this post is old but just incase someone else comes across this... The ANA test is not to test for inflammation. The CRP (C-Reactive Protein) tests for inflammation. An ANA test detects antinuclear antibodies in your blood. Your immune system normally makes antibodies to help you fight infection. In contrast, antinuclear antibodies often attack your body's own tissues \u2014 specifically targeting each cell's nucleus. (per Mayo Clinics website) Put simply this test is looking for protein in your blood that destroys the nuclei of your cells. It is possible to test positive on an ANA test without having any symptoms of sickness (seemingly healthy) but if you have tested positive at some point in life you will more than likely begin to have symptoms of an autoimmune disease. Multiple Sclerosis is an autoimmune disease so it makes perfect sense that the ANA test woud come back positive with this disease."

Abro este nuevo tema porque me gustar\u00eda compartir con todos cu\u00e1l esta siendo mi experiencia y cu\u00e1les son los avances que \u00e9stos ni\u00f1os est\u00e1n alcanzando. La metodolog\u00eda que aplico con ellos es el M\u00e9todo ABA (Applied Behavior Analysis), An\u00e1lisis de conducta Aplicado. En estos momentos, una ni\u00f1a con la que trabajo tiene 4 a\u00f1os y ya ha aprendido los n\u00fameros del 1 al 10, relaciona  los n\u00fameros con sus cantidades (lo que implica un mayor nivel de abstracci\u00f3n), discrimina objetos atendiendo a varios criterios (por ejemplo, seg\u00fan color y forma), discrimina conceptos opuestos (por ejemplo, arriba abajo, mucho poco, dentro fuera, encima debajo, etc), identifica algunas letras y relaciona algunas  im\u00e1genes con sus correspondientes palabras. El motivo para contar todo esto es porque no he encontrado en la bibliograf\u00eda el caso de otros ni\u00f1os o ni\u00f1as que a esta edad ya sean capaces de hacer este tipo de tareas. Mi pregunta es, \u00bfalguno de ustedes conoce de alg\u00fan ni\u00f1o o ni\u00f1a de 4 a\u00f1os que presente habilidades similares? Si es el caso, \u00bfpodr\u00edan contarme cual ha sido la experiencia? Muchas gracias de antemano, espero poder contribuir a este foro en todo lo que pueda. Un saludo Omayra",

MI nombre es Mar\u00eda, soy de Toledo y soy madre de un ni\u00f1o de 6 a\u00f1os con S\u00edndrome de Angelman. Se llama Mario y est\u00e1 francamente bien, teniendo en cuenta lo negro que nos lo pusieron al darnos el diagn\u00f3stico. Nosotros no hemos seguido con Mario ning\u00fan m\u00e9todo espec\u00edfico, s\u00f3lo reforzamos lo que trabaja en el logopeda y en el colegio. Asiste a un colegio ordinario, aunque tiene apoyo de logopeda y una PT una hora diaria. Por la tarde, acude dos veces en semana a piscina y a logopeda. Cuando nos planteamos el tema de la comunicaci\u00f3n, descubrimos que Mario era bueno aprendiendo signos, por lo que empezamos a trabajar con \u00e9l lengua de signos (realmente, \"lenguaje bimodal&quot . A d\u00eda de hoy, \u00e9l solo est\u00e1 eliminando los signos, porque est\u00e1 empezando a hablar. L\u00f3gicamente, no habla como un ni\u00f1o \"normal\", pero se expresa muy bien; hay dos fonemas que a\u00fan no pronuncia claramente, la \"l\" y la \"r\", por lo que las palabras que los contienen le cuestan m\u00e1s. Pero \u00e9l intenta repetir absolutamente todas las palabras. Empez\u00f3 diciendo bis\u00edlabos como pap\u00e1, mam\u00e1, cama, casa, etc.....Luego sigui\u00f3 con palabras m\u00e1s dif\u00edciles como galleta, zapatilla.......Hoy d\u00eda pronuncia cosas como \"helic\u00f3ptero\". Todo lo que dice lo hace con pleno sentido y en el contexto adecuado. Antes s\u00f3lo dec\u00eda palabras suekltas, pero ahora empieza a construir frases completas. Aparte de esto, Mario conoce todos los n\u00fameros del 1 al 10, cuenta correctamente hasta el 15, cuenta del 1 al 10 en ingl\u00e9s, asocia n\u00fameros con cantidades, realiza sumas con apoyo visual..... Con respecto a la lectura, conoce todas las letras, tanto may\u00fasculas como min\u00fasculas. Estamos empezando a ense\u00f1arle a leer y ya reconoce palabras como mano, mesa, mam\u00e1, pap\u00e1, mira, moto y mu\u00f1eca. Hace poco, en facebook he puesto algunos v\u00eddeos de Mario. MI perfil es Mar\u00eda Cano Moraleda, por si quieres echarle un vistazo. Estoy a tu disposici\u00f3n para contarte todo lo que quieras, porque soy consciente de que el caso de mi hijo es bastante raro en el SA. Un abrazo.",

En cuanto a el metodo aba en su caso le ha ido muy bien y ya lo he comentado a la presidente de la asociacion para ver si en mayo va omaira a presentar lo que est\u00e1 haciendo sara de hecho tenemos videos grabados incluso con la logopeda del centro al que va que esta muy sorprndida con lo que hizo,para que comprendas de que va el tema nosotros nunca le habiamos ense\u00f1ado los numeros del 1 al 10 y un dia empezamos a probar si los sab\u00eda y no solo acierta el numero ademas le ponemos por ejemplo 2 circulos y 9 circulos le ense\u00f1amos el 9 y le decimos el numero en voz alta y va hacia el numero adecuado,despues supe que en elcolegio otros ni\u00f1os los trabajaban en voz alta y ella tuvo que quedarse con todo,alguien del foro pregunraba si camina ,solo gatea y camina con ayuda  cuando le realizamos los ejercicios la llevamos por la cintura para darle estabilidad y ella se dirije hacia donde quiere. Por ultimo decir que siempre he sido esceptico con lo de que un ni\u00f1o angelman lea y escriba pero despues de lo que he visto en mi hija ya no me pongo un limite es mas aunque me tachen de loco reduciria la escala de retraso mental de severo  a leve ,para mi lo peor en nuestros hijos es que es un trastorno que tiene muchas caracteristicas parecidas al autismo",

    "angelman Re: Compartir experiencias 29-February-2012 21:46 Admin Registrado: 49 a\u00f1os antes Mensajes: 50 Hola Juanjo, en primer lugar, bienvenido a este foro.. Es realmente sorprendente lo que Omayra ha conseguido con Sara, especialmente, teniendo en cuenta que es una deleci\u00f3n. Siempre damos por hecho que los ni\u00f1os que consiguen logros importantes es porque tienen una etiolog\u00eda distinta a la deleci\u00f3n, pero el caso de tu hija demuestra que no es as\u00ed. Hemos de confiar en nuestros ni\u00f1os: si no son capaces de hacer algo, que sean ellos mismos los que lo indiquen, pero no les pongamos l\u00edmites nosotros de antemano. Sobre el retraso mental severo, es frecuente leer que el retraso que se les atribuye es mayor de lo que en realidad es, debido a su incapacidad para hablar. Puede servirnos este hilo para que las familias opinen sobre si les gustar\u00eda contar con Omayra como ponente en el pr\u00f3ximo encuentro de familias que se celebrar\u00e1 en el mes de septiembre. Lo consideramos realmente interesante. Un saludo.",

En cuanto al tiempo que lleva con el tratamiento experimental empezo en junio del 2009 con aba empez\u00f3 en septiembre del 2009  nacio el 11de mayo del 2007 y tuvimos el diagnostico genetico el 11 de mayo del 2008 aunque a pesar de ser prematura de 33 semanas el medico pidio las pruebas geneticas desde diciembre del 2007. Con el tratamiento experimental lo unico que apreciamos fue una disminucion del temblor ataxico y un aumento de la atencion.Para el tto fuy a dallas  y previa puncion lumbar detectaron que efectivamente tenia a nivel cerebral el acido folico bajo y la homocisteina alta por lo que era aconsejable, de todas formas el logro mayor en texas fue controlarle las crisis epilepticas a\u00fan as\u00ed hace una e\u00f1o le ense\u00f1\u00e9 videos de lo que sara hac\u00eda en ese momento al neurologo que la atendio en dallas (que por ciert es espa\u00f1ol) y estaba sorprendidisimo de sus avances por lo que estoy deseando volver a verlo para ense\u00f1arle los ultimos avances ,de todas formas no quiero dar falsas esperanzas a ningun padre el sindrome esta ah\u00ed y por ejemplo a nivel motorico sara no es de las que mejor est\u00e1(aunque pienso queel anterior centro de fisioterapia al que iba noera el adecuado y tarde 2 a\u00f1os en darme cuenta)",
    "juanjo Re: Compartir experiencias 01-March-2012 00:08 Registrado: 7 a\u00f1os antes Mensajes: 61 Quer\u00eda aclarar que en texas me dijeron que el tto tenia que ser pautado por un medico y no tomarlo en casa sin un seguimiento pues la betaina por ejemplo tiene que ser anhidra y la que se vende fuera de farmacia es betaina con pepsina que puede dar iritacion gastrica y no tiene el mismo efecto, yo tuve que estar trayendola de E.E.U.U.durante un a\u00f1o y pagaba unos 500 euros cada tres meses ademas tenia que ser con alguien que viajara hasta all\u00ed por qu si no la requisan en la aduana por ser un medicamento ,al finaldespues de hacer otra puncion lumbar en las palmas y ver que los niveles se habian normalizado pude conseguirla como tto compasivo  pero como cada vez hay mas restricciones espero que no me lo retiren. Aun asi personalmente creo que el tto experimental puede haber ayudado a mi hija a mejorar en un 5 o 10% el resto de los avances creo que son debidos al control de la epilepsia y al metodo aba. Tambiencomentar que en texas me aclararon queen muchos casos no se conseguia ninguna mejoria con el mismo, tambien pregunte all\u00ed por el tto del dr weber y decian que era muy prematuro decir nada sobre el mismo por que los experimentos en ratones solo demostraban que presentaban una mayor respuesta de miedo ante determinadas situaciones  en comparacion con los ratones con angelman sin tratar pero que eso no demostraba que mejoraran en todos los efectos 2\u00ba del sindrome, saludos.",

Cuando sara fue a texas ya tomaba algo de acido folico por ejemplo y en la puncion lumbar se descubrio que tenia el acido folico a nivel cerebral bajo, de hecho yo le comente al neurologo que antes de ir all\u00ed en una epoca que estuvo peor de la epilepsia le retire el acido folico y no solo no cedieron las crisis sino que tambien empeor\u00f3 el temblor,de hecho uno de los investigadores del estudio coment\u00f3 que el no not\u00f3 ningun cambio en los ni\u00f1os pero que el 50% de los padres quizo seguir el tto por que observaron lo mismo que yo ,de todas formas hace poco les envi\u00e9 a los neurologos de texas un email para ver si se podian poner en contacto con uno de los investigadores ,pues el estudio ya esta terminado , para saber las conclusiones del mismo pero no me han contestado, volvere a enviarle otro email y cuando me contesten os comentar\u00e9 lo que me digan",

AS es causada por un cromosoma 15 faltantes o incompletos que se hereda de la madre. Diagn\u00f3stico de la EA se hace generalmente entre tres y siete a\u00f1os de edad, cuando las conductas caracter\u00edsticas y rasgos de la enfermedad se hacen m\u00e1s evidentes. Antes de que el diagn\u00f3stico, los s\u00edntomas pueden confundirse con par\u00e1lisis cerebral o autismo. Terapia f\u00edsica, ocupacional y del habla, el desarrollo de habilidades de comunicaci\u00f3n, y ayudar a la modificaci\u00f3n del comportamiento para mejorar la calidad de vida de estos ni\u00f1os, pero se necesitan otros tratamientos. En un estudio anterior, la disminuci\u00f3n de la metilaci\u00f3n del ADN, que es un tipo de cambio qu\u00edmico en el ADN, se observ\u00f3 en un individuo con AS, esta condici\u00f3n puede ser una causa primaria de la EA. La hip\u00f3tesis es que la promoci\u00f3n de la metilaci\u00f3n del ADN podr\u00eda aument\u00f3 reducir la severidad de los s\u00edntomas de AS. B12 beta\u00edna, la creatina, Metafolin, y la vitamina son compuestos que se encuentran normalmente en el cuerpo que est\u00e1n involucradas en la v\u00eda de la metilaci\u00f3n del ADN. El aumento de las concentraciones de estos compuestos en el cuerpo puede aumentar la metilaci\u00f3n del ADN. Este estudio evaluar\u00e1 la eficacia de cuatro suplementos diet\u00e9ticos en el tratamiento de los s\u00edntomas de la AS. Este estudio tendr\u00e1 una duraci\u00f3n de 12 meses. Las visitas del estudio se realizar\u00e1n al inicio del estudio y los 12 meses. Un selecto grupo de participantes, los que cumplen los criterios diagn\u00f3sticos para el autismo, tambi\u00e9n se evaluar\u00e1 en el mes 6. En las visitas de estudio, los participantes se someter\u00e1n a un electroencefalograma (EEG). La historia cl\u00ednica, examen f\u00edsico, ex\u00e1menes neurol\u00f3gicos y evaluaciones del desarrollo tambi\u00e9n se llevar\u00e1 a cabo. Recolecci\u00f3n de orina y sangre, incluyendo pruebas para determinar los niveles en sangre de los suplementos alimenticios, se producir\u00e1 al inicio del estudio ya los 6 meses y 12 a\u00f1os. Los participantes recibir\u00e1n dos dosis diarias de Metafolin, beta\u00edna, y la creatina, y una dosis diaria de vitamina B12 para la duraci\u00f3n del estudio.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of certain dietary supplements in treating the symptoms of AS. Condition Intervention Angelman Syndrome Nervous System Diseases Drug: Betaine Drug: Creatine Drug: Metafolin Drug: Vitamin B12 Study Type: Interventional Study Design: Allocation: Non-Randomized Endpoint Classification: Efficacy Study Intervention Model: Single Group Assignment Masking: Open Label Primary Purpose: Treatment Official Title: Efficacy of a Therapeutic Treatment Trial in Angelman Syndrome Resource links provided by NLM: Genetics Home Reference related topics: 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome Angelman syndrome autosomal recessive primary microcephaly familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia Friedreich ataxia pyridoxine-dependent epilepsy tetrasomy 18p MedlinePlus related topics: B Vitamins Dietary Supplements Neurologic Diseases Drug Information available for: Creatine Vitamin B 12 Hydroxocobalamin Betaine Betaine hydrochloride Creatine monohydrate U.S. FDA Resources Further study details as provided by University of California, San Diego: Primary Outcome Measures: \u2022Improvement in functioning across development, including acquisition of milestones, improvements in speech and communications skills, and behavioral or physical changes [ Time Frame: Measured at Months 6 and 12 ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] Secondary Outcome Measures: \u2022Comparison of pre- and post-treatment levels of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH), S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), dimethylglycine, methionine, homocysteine, betaine, creatine, guanidinoacetate, red blood cell folate, and DNA methylation response [ Time Frame: Measured at Months 6 and 12 ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] Enrollment: 90 Study Start Date: July 2006 Study Completion Date: February 2010 Primary Completion Date: February 2010 (Final data collection date for primary outcome measure) Arms Assigned Interventions 1: Experimental Participants will receive two daily doses of Metafolin, betaine, and creatine, and one daily dose of vitamin B12 for 12 months. Interventions: \u2022Drug: Betaine \u2022Drug: Creatine \u2022Drug: Metafolin \u2022Drug: Vitamin B12 Drug: Betaine 100-200 mg per kg per day by mouth with a maximum of 6 grams divided in two daily doses Drug: Creatine 200 mg per kg per day with a daily maximum of 5 grams divided in two daily doses Drug: Metafolin 0.5 mg per kg per day by mouth with a maximum of 8 milligrams divided in two daily doses Drug: Vitamin B12 1 mg by mouth per day for all weights and ages Detailed Description: AS is a neurologic disorder that may cause developmental delay, mental retardation, severe speech impairment, seizures, small head size, and problems with movement and balance in young children. AS is caused by a missing or incomplete chromosome 15 that is inherited from the mother. Diagnosis of AS is usually made between three and seven years of age, when the characteristic behaviors and features of the disease become most evident. Prior to AS diagnosis, the symptoms may be mistaken for cerebral palsy or autism. Physical, occupational, and speech therapy, communication skills development, and behavior modification help to improve the quality of life of these children, but other treatments are needed. In a previous study, decreased DNA methylation, which is a type of chemical change in DNA, was observed in an individual with AS; this condition may be a primary cause of AS. It is hypothesized that promoting increased DNA methylation might reduce the severity of AS symptoms. Betaine, creatine, Metafolin, and vitamin B12 are compounds normally found in the body that are involved in the DNA methylation pathway. Increasing the concentrations of these compounds in the body may enhance DNA methylation. This study will evaluate the efficacy of four dietary supplements in treating the symptoms of AS. This study will last 12 months. Study visits will occur at study entry and Month 12. A selected group of participants, those who meet the diagnostic criteria for autism, will also be evaluated at Month 6. At study visits, participants will undergo an electroencephalogram (EEG). Medical history, physical exam, neurological exams, and developmental assessments will also be performed. Urine and blood collection, including tests to determine the blood levels of the dietary supplements, will occur at study entry and Months 6 and 12. Participants will receive two daily doses of Metafolin, betaine, and creatine, and one daily dose of vitamin B12 for the duration of the study. Parents will be asked to complete a questionnaire at each visit to report their child's behavior while taking the dietary supplements. Parents will also be contacted by phone periodically to assess changes and/or progress in their children. Eligibility Ages Eligible for Study: up to 5 Years Genders Eligible for Study: Both Accepts Healthy Volunteers: No Criteria Inclusion Criteria: \u2022Diagnosis of AS \u2022In stable condition with relatively good control of seizures \u2022Willing to comply with treatment, study visit schedule, and study assessments \u2022Willing to take oral or G-tube medication \u2022Willing to be contacted monthly during the course of the study \u2022Parent or guardian willing to provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria: \u2022History of liver or kidney disease \u2022Currently being treated for a serious acute illness \u2022Known hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs \u2022Received high-dose folate drug treatment in the 12 months prior to study entry \u2022Other significant medical problems, including those involving the liver, kidney, or heart \u2022Other comorbidities, genetic disorders, or extreme prematurity; children with autism are not excluded Contacts and Locations Please refer to this study by its ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00348933 Locations United States, California Rady Children's Hospital San Diego San Diego, California, United States, 92123 United States, Massachusetts Children's Hospital Boston Boston, Massachusetts, United States United States, South Carolina Greenwood Genetics Center Greenwood, South Carolina, United States United States, Texas Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas, United States Sponsors and Collaborators University of California, San Diego Baylor College of Medicine Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego Children's Hospital Boston Greenwood Genetic Center Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network Investigators Principal Investigator: Arthur L.

    "mtcano Re: Compartir experiencias 02-March-2012 20:15 Registrado: 8 a\u00f1os antes Mensajes: 40 Hola Juanjo, te respondo a lo que me preguntabas sobre Mario. El es angelman por defecto de impronta. Hasta ahora (y cruzo los dedos) nunca ha tenido ninguna crisis, ni ausencia ni nada parecido. A nivel motor est\u00e1 muy bien, empez\u00f3 a caminar con 20 meses y ahora mismo salta corre, se sube a todos los muebles de la casa, nada sin manguitos ni flotadores......enfin, una locura. En cuanto a lo de conocer los n\u00fameros, cuando realmente mejor\u00f3 fue el a\u00f1o pasado, con 5 a\u00f1os ya conoc\u00eda todas las letras y los n\u00fameros del 1 al 10 (ahora ya llega contando hasta el 15). Mario est\u00e1 en un colegio ordinario y ha aprendido igual que sus compa\u00f1eros, tanto las letras como los n\u00fameros; a un ritmo m\u00e1s lento, es cierto, pero ha aprendido como uno m\u00e1s. De hecho, es capaz de contar hasta diez tambi\u00e9n en ingl\u00e9s, s\u00f3lo por haberlo oido en clase. Sobre lo que me preguntas de trabajarle la boca, siempre ha sido imposible. Intentamos masajes para controlarle el babeo, pero no hab\u00eda manera de meterle el dedo en la boca. Los logopedas han intentado ponerle depresores para ayudarle con ciertos fonemas que a\u00fan le cuestan (la \"l\" y la \"r&quot , pero es imposible. Cuando empez\u00f3 a pronunciar m\u00e1s fonemas fue cuando consigui\u00f3 el soplo, a partir de ese momento empez\u00f3 a pronunciar la \"f\", la \"s\" y otros; la logopeda del colegio le pon\u00eda bolitas de papel encima de la mesa y trataba de que las moviera soplando, le hizo mucha gracia y lo convirti\u00f3 en su reto personal. El soplo lo logr\u00f3 en 2009, con 3 a\u00f1os reci\u00e9n cumplidos. Pero, cuando le hemos notado m\u00e1s mejor\u00eda en el lenguaje oral ha sido cuando empez\u00f3 a hablar mi segundo hijo. Le motivaba y le imitaba. Mario ten\u00eda entonces 4 a\u00f1os. Estuve viendo el v\u00eddeo del blog de Omayra, y la verdad es que lo de Sara es sorprendente. Enhorabuena y seguid adelante. Por otra parte, no s\u00e9 si sabes que formo parte de la junta directiva de ASA. Si sabes algo del estudio de Estados Unidos y crees que podemos hacer algo a nivel asociaci\u00f3n, no dudes en dec\u00edrnoslo. Mi tel\u00e9fono es 639 986 436. Un abrazo.",
    "juanjo Re: Compartir experiencias 03-March-2012 00:59 Registrado: 7 a\u00f1os antes Mensajes: 61 Muchas gracias por contestarme maria teresa, la verdad es que me has dado unas pautas que pueden ser interesantes para aplicarlas con sara,sobre el tto experimental la verdad es que he visto muchos email pidiendo informacion y no esperaba que despertara tanta expectacion , estoy pendiente de que isaac me conteste desde texas pues probablemente sea mas facil para Isaac saber que conclusiones se extrajeron del mismo, yo ya he comentado que not\u00e9 una cierta mejoria en mi hija pero no puedo saber a ciencia cierta si es por el tto, pues  coincidi\u00f3  el comienzo del mismo con los cambios en el tto antiepileptico que mejoraron las crisis por eso prefiero esperar a la contestacion del neurologo de las palmas que esta en texas(isaac),de todas formas mi opinion sobre estos temas es que no se puede abordar el tto terapeutico de estos ni\u00f1os desde un solo aspecto si no que debe ser multidisciplinar, por ejemplo en el caso de sara tambien esta con un logopeda de apoyo 3 dias en semana ,aba 6 dias en semana y ahora estamos potenciando la fisioterapia por que en el centro en que estaba hasta julio del a\u00f1o pasado decian que con lo que ellos hacian era suficiente ,ahora tiene en el nuevo centro 3 dias en semana fisioterapia, un fisioterapeuta va a mi casa otros 3 dias en semana y aparte va a un centro de fisioterapia 5 dias a la semana y ya ha empezado a gatear sola e intenta mantenerse sola de hecho da pasos acompa\u00f1ada como se ve en el blog  , en conclusion mi experiencia con mi hija me dice que hay que abordar varios campos terapeuticos y que cuanto mas tiempo dedica a trabajar mejor ,es mas ,mi hija cuando mejor duerme es en la epoca de clases y cuando esta de vacaciones se descompensa mas, un saludo.",

I take 2 different oils, one during the day and the other before bed. The reason for 2 different is they are made from different strains, are different strengths and I feel help differently.

Just for my benefit is this the right site?  every time I entered CBD brothers into Google it took to a different page, all CBD oil sites but not always mentioning the CBD brothers? I will report back on how I find it once it arrives & iv\u2019e tried it a few times.

I am having amongst other issues a real problem with hand dexterity in such away that it feels like my fingers have become magnetic & are sticking together, this makes it impossible to do some simple tasks like buttoning up a shirt, lifting coins from a table or texting on my mobile .  I am hoping that the CBD oil will somehow neutralise this magnetism & offer me some relief. I have bladder weakness which is a real pain, going to have Botox in my Bladder June 3rd.  My memory & cognitive skills are completely shot. I appreciate that in the grand scheme of things my difficulties must seem very futile compared to others, but I feel that this is what is holding me back the most because it effects everything that I do in life.

So has  promised here is my update after taking the Blue CBD from theoriginalalternative.com since 22nd of May.  I know that its only early days but I can honestly say that I feel no different.  After examining my empty bottle I noticed that on the label it states >5% CBD!  A couple of the posts on here state that the dose needs to be at least 10% CBD or higher & a couple have said that they are taking 15% CBD.  So do I try it again & order a higher dosage?  Or am I just throwing good money after bad, your thoughts please? Any input would be appreciated.",

In answer to your question, yes it is worth taking, the results are noted, not just for MS but general well being, look onto the internet http://www.wholesorts.com my blog, I thing the June edition I give links, if you are on Facebook there is a great company listed, I have a years supply as it was a deal from Healthspan, good luck",

    "beefree 5 months ago Hi @diaflash I use CBD oil and have noticed positive effects in reducing spasms, twitches and a mild psychogenic tremor. My sleep has also improved but I\u2019ve been trying a couple of things for that, which makes it harder to attribute to the CBD oil. Quality and process are really important. I tried a couple of oils before finding the right quality for my needs. I get it delivered from a shop in Edinburgh called Hemp ( https://hempcanhelp.co.uk ). It\u2019s expensive but worth it, I find. With process, consistency over time is the important thing. The benefits for me kicked in 2-3 weeks after taking every morning and night. I started on 5% and then increased to 10%. I don\u2019t find that it has much immediate effect i.e. if my muscles are feeling tense it won\u2019t immediately relax them. Rather, over the time that I\u2019ve taken CBD oil consistently, my general level of spasticity has reduced. Hope useful.",
