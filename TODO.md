# Open issues

## post extraction
- detect lead posts (compare: mumsnet.com)

## URL extraction

- healthunlocked.com: replies do not have any URL
- shift.ms, medhelp.org, msconnection.org, mumsnet.com -> no URLs for replies
- uninterrupted.org.au -> no real forum but rather a blog

## date extraction

- workaround for lead elements:
  -> consider the number of posts or the number of posts + a spare for the main post

## user extraction

- based on URL
